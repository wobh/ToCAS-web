    &mdash;The Song of Xeethra
</aside>

<p>On Zothique, the last continent on Earth, the sun no longer shone
with the whiteness of its prime, but was dim and tarnished as if with
a vapor of blood. New stars without number had declared themselves in
the heavens, and the shadows of the infinite had fallen closer. And
out of the shadows, the older gods had returned to man: the gods
forgotten since Hyperborea, since Mu and Poseidonis, bearing other
names but the same attributes. And the elder demons had also returned,
battening on the fumes of evil sacrifice, and fostering again the
primordial sorceries.</p>

<p>Many were the necromancers and magicians of Zothique, and the
infamy and marvel of their doings were legended everywhere in the
latter days. But among them all there was none greater than Namirrha,
who imposed his black yoke on the cities of Xylac, and later, in a
proud delirium, deemed himself the veritable peer of Thasaidon, lord
of Evil.</p>

<p>Namirrha had built his abode in Ummaos, the chief town of Xylac, to
which he came from the desert realm of Tasuun with the dark renown of
his thaumaturgies like a cloud of desert storm behind him. And no man
knew that in coming to Ummaos he returned to the city of his birth;
for all deemed him a native of Tasuun. Indeed, none could have dreamt
that the great sorcerer was one with the beggar-boy Narthos, an orphan
of questionable parentage, who had begged his daily bread in the
streets and bazaars of Ummaos. Wretchedly had he lived, alone and
despised; and a hatred of the cruel, opulent city grew in his heart
like a smothered flame that feeds in secret, biding the time when it
shall become a conflagration consuming all things.</p>

<p>Bitterer always, through his boyhood and early youth, was the
spleen and rancor of Narthos toward men. And one day the prince
Zotulla, a boy but little older than he, riding a restive palfrey,
came upon him in the square before the imperial palace; and Narthos
implored an alms. But Zotulla, scorning his plea, rode arrogantly
forward, spurring the palfrey; and Narthos was ridden down and
trampled under its hooves. And afterward, nigh to death from the
trampling, he lay senseless for many hours, while the people passed
him by unheeding. And at last, regaining his senses, he dragged
himself to his hovel; but he limped a little thereafter all his days,
and the mark of one hoof remained like a brand on his body, fading
never. Later, he left Ummaos, and was forgotten quickly by its
people. Going southward into Tasuun, he lost his way in the great
desert, and was near to perishing. But finally he came to a small
oasis, where dwelt the wizard Ouphaloc, a hermit who preferred the
company of honest jackals and hyenas to that of men. And Ouphaloc,
seeing the great craft and evil in the starveling boy, gave succor to
Narthos and sheltered him. He dwelt for years with Ouphaloc, becoming
the wizard's pupil and the heir of his demon-wrested lore. Strange
things he learned in that hermitage, being fed on fruits and grain
that had sprung not from the watered earth, and wine that was not the
juice of terrene grapes. And like Ouphaloc, he became a master in
devildom and drove his own bond with the archfiend Thasaidon. When
Ouphaloc died, he took the name of Namirrha, and went forth as a
mighty sorcerer among the wandering peoples and the deep-buried
mummies of Tasuun. But never could he forget the miseries of his
boyhood in Ummaos and the wrong he had endured from Zotulla; and year
by year he spun over in his thoughts the black web of revenge. And his
fame grew ever darker and vaster, and men feared him in remote lands
beyond Tasuun. With bated whispers they spoke of his deeds in the
cities of Yoros, and in Zul-Bha-Shair, the abode of the ghoulish deity
Mordiggian. And long before the coming of Namirrha himself, the people
of Ummaos knew him as a fabled scourge that was direr than simoom or
pestilence.</p>

<p>Now, in the years that followed the going-forth of the boy Narthos
from Ummaos, Pithaim, the father of Prince Zotulla, was slain by the
sting of a small adder that had crept into his bed for warmth on an
autumn night. Some said that the adder had been purveyed by Zotulla,
but this was a thing that no man could verily affirm. After the death
of Pithaim, Zotulla, being his only son, was emperor of Xylac, and
ruled evilly from his throne in Ummaos. Indolent he was, and tyrannic,
and full of strange luxuries and cruelties; but the people, who were
also evil, acclaimed him in his turpitude. So he prospered, and the
lords of Hell and Heaven smote him not. And the red suns and ashen
moons went westward over Xylac, falling into that seldom-voyaged sea,
which, if the mariners' tales were true, poured evermore like a
swiftening river past the infamous isle of Naat, and fell in a
worldwide cataract upon nether space from the far, sheer edge of
Earth.</p>

<p>Grosser still he grew, and his sins were as overswollen fruits that
ripen above a deep abyss. But the winds of time blew softly; and the
fruits fell not. And Zotulla laughed amid his fools and his eunuchs
and his lemans; and the tale of his luxuries was borne afar, and was
told by dim outland peoples, as a twin marvel with the bruited
necromancies of Namirrha.</p>

<p>It came to pass, in the year of the Hyena, and the month of the
star Canicule, that a great feast was given by Zotulla to the
inhabitants of Ummaos. Meats that had been cooked in exotic spices
from Sotar, isle of the east, were spread everywhere; and the ardent
wines of Yoros and Xylac, filled as with subterranean fires, were
poured inexhaustibly from huge urns for all. The wines awoke a furious
mirth and a royal madness; and afterward they brought a slumber no
less profound than the Lethe of the tomb. And one by one, as they
drank, the revellers fell down in the streets, the houses and gardens,
as if a plague had struck them; and Zotulla slept in his banquet-hall
of gold and ebony, with his odalisques and chamberlains about him. So,
in all Ummaos, there was no man or woman wakeful at the hour when
Sirius began to fall toward the west.</p>

<p>Thus it was that none saw or heard the coming of Namirrha. But
awakening heavily in the latter forenoon, the emperor Zotulla heard a
confused babble, a troublous clamor of voices from such of his eunuchs
and women as had awakened before him. Inquiring the cause, he was told
that a strange prodigy had occurred during the night; but, being still
bemused with wine and slumber, he comprehended little enough of its
nature, till his favorite concubine, Obexah, led him to the eastern
portico of the palace, from which he could behold the marvel with his
own eyes.</p>

<p>Now the palace stood alone at the center of Ummaos, and to the
north, west and south, for wide intervals of distance, there stretched
the imperial gardens, full of superbly arching palms and loftily
spiring fountains. But to eastward was a broad open area, used as a
sort of common, between the palace and the mansions of high
optimates. And in this space, which had lain wholly vacant at eve, a
building towered colossal and lordly beneath the full-risen sun, with
domes like monstrous fungi of stone that had come up in the night. And
the domes, rearing level with those of Zotulla, were builded of
death-white marble; and the huge fa&ccedil;ade, with multi-columned
porticoes and deep balconies, was wrought in alternate zones of
night-black onyx and porphyry hued as with dragons' blood. And Zotulla
swore lewdly, calling with hoarse blasphemies on the gods and devils
of Xylac; and great was his dumfoundment, deeming the marvel a work of
wizardry. The women gathered about him, crying out with shrill cries
of awe and terror; and more and more of his courtiers, awakening, came
to swell the hub-bub; and the fat castradoes diddered in their
cloth-of-gold like immense black jellies in golden basins. But
Zotulla, mindful of his dominion as emperor of all Xylac, strove to
conceal his own trepidation, saying:</p>

<p><q>Now who is this that has presumed to enter Ummaos like a jackal
in the dark, and has made his impious den in proximity and counterview
of my palace? Go forth, and inquire the miscreant's name; but ere you
go, instruct the headsman to make sharp his double-handed
sword.</q></p>

<p>Then, fearing the emperor's wrath if they tarried, certain of the
chamberlains went forth unwillingly and approached the portals of the
strange edifice. It seemed that the portals were deserted till they
drew near, and then, on the threshold, there appeared a titanic
skeleton, taller than any man of earth; and it strode forward to meet
them with ell-long strides. The skeleton was swathed in a loin-cloth
of scarlet silk with a buckle of jet, and it wore a black turban,
starred with diamonds, whose topmost foldings nearly touched the high
lintel. Eyes like flickering marsh-fires burned in its deep
eye-sockets; and a blackened tongue like that of a long-dead man
protruded between its teeth; but otherwise it was clean of flesh, and
the bones glittered whitely in the sun as it came onward.</p>

<p>The chamberlains were mute before it, and there was no sound except
the golden creaking of their girdles, the shrill rustling of their
silks, as they shook and trembled. And the foot-bones of the skeleton
clicked sharply on the pavement of black onyx as it paused; and the
putrefying tongue began to quiver between its teeth; and it uttered
these words in an unctuous, nauseous voice:</p>

<p><q>Return, and tell the emperor Zotulla that Namirrha, seer and
magician, has come to dwell beside him.</q></p>

<p>Hearing the skeleton speak as if it had been a living man, and
hearing the dread name of Namirrha as men hear the tocsin of doom in
some fallen city, the chamberlains could stand before it no longer,
and they fled with ungainly swiftness and bore the message to
Zotulla.</p>

<p>Now, learning who it was that had come to neighbor with him in
Ummaos, the emperor's wrath died out like a feeble and blustering
flame on which the wind of darkness had blown; and the vinous purple
of his cheeks was mottled with a strange pallor; and he said nothing,
but his lips mumbled loosely as if in prayer or malediction. And the
news of Namirrha's coming passed like the flight of evil night-birds
through all the palace and throughout the city, leaving a noisome
terror that abode in Ummaos thereafter till the end. For Namirrha,
through the black renown of his thaumaturgies and the frightful
entities who served him, had become a power that no secular sovereign
dared dispute; and men feared him everywhere, even as they feared the
gigantic, shadowy lords of Hell and of outer space. And in Ummaos,
people said that he had come on the desert wind from Tasuun with his
underlings, even as the pestilence comes, and had reared his house in
an hour with the aid of devils beside Zotulla's palace. And they said
that the foundations of the house were laid on the adamantine cope of
Hell; and in its floors were pits at whose bottom burned the nether
fires, or stars could be seen as they passed under in lowermost
night. And the followers of Namirrha were the dead of strange
kingdoms, the demons of sky and earth and the abyss, and mad, impious,
hybrid things that the sorcerer himself created from forbidden
unions.</p>

<p>Men shunned the neighborhood of his lordly house; and in the palace
of Zotulla few cared to approach the windows and balconies that gave
thereon; and the emperor himself spoke not of Namirrha, pretending to
ignore the intruder; and the women of the harem babbled evermore with
an evil gossip concerning Namirrha and his concubines. But the
sorcerer himself was not beheld by the people of that city, though
some believed that he walked forth at will, clad with
invisibility. His servitors were likewise not seen; but a howling as
of the damned was sometimes heard to issue from his portals; and
sometimes there came a strange cachinnation, as if some adamantine
image had laughed aloud; and sometimes there was a chuckling like the
sound of shattered ice in a frozen hell. Dim shadows moved in the
porticoes when there was neither sunlight nor lamp to cast them; and
red, eery lights appeared and vanished in the windows at eve, like a
blinking of demoniac eyes. And slowly the ember-colored suns went over
Xylac, and were quenched in far seas; and the ashy moons were
blackened as they fell nightly toward the hidden gulf. Then, seeing
that the wizard had wrought no open evil, and that none had endured
palpable harm from his presence, the people took heart; and Zotulla
drank deeply, and feasted in oblivious luxury as before; and dark
Thasaidon, prince of all turpitudes, was the true but
never-acknowledged lord of Xylac. And in time the men of Ummaos
bragged a little of Namirrha and his dread thaumaturgies, even as they
had boasted of the purple sins of Zotulla.</p>

<p>But Namirrha, still unbeheld by living men and living women, sat in
the inner walls of that house which his devils had reared for him, and
spun over and over in his thoughts the black web of revenge. And the
wrong done by Zotulla to Narthos in old times was the least of those
cruelties which the emperor had forgotten.</p>

<p>Now, when the fears of Zotulla were somewhat lulled, and his women
gossiped less often of the neighboring wizard, there occurred a new
wonder and a fresh terror. For, sitting one eve at his banquet-table
with his courtiers about him, the emperor heard a noise as of myriad
iron-shod hooves that came trampling through the palace gardens. And
the courtiers also heard the sound, and were startled amid their
mounting drunkenness; and the emperor was angered, and he sent certain
of his guards to examine into the cause of the trampling. But peering
forth upon the moon-bright lawns and parterres, the guards beheld no
visible shape, though the loud sounds of trampling still went to and
fro. It seemed as if a rout of wild stallions passed and re-passed
before the fa&ccedil;ade of the palace with tumultuous gallopings and
capricoles. And a fear came upon the guards as they looked and
listened; and they dared not venture forth, but returned to
Zotulla. And the emperor himself grew sober when he heard their tale;
and he went forth with high blusterings to view the prodigy. And all
night the unseen hooves rang out sonorously on the pavement of onyx,
and ran with deep thuddings over the grasses and flowers. The
palm-fronds waved on the windless air as if parted by racing steeds;
and visibly the tall-stemmed lilies and broad-petaled exotic blossoms
were trodden under. And rage and terror nested together in Zotulla's
heart as he stood in a balcony above the garden, hearing the spectral
tumult, and beholding the harm done to his rarest flower-beds. The
women, the courtiers and eunuchs cowered behind him, and there was no
slumber for any occupant of the palace; but toward dawn the clamor of
hooves departed, going toward Namirrha's house.</p>

<p>When the dawn was full-grown above Ummaos, the emperor walked forth
with his guards about him, and saw that the crushed grasses and
broken-down stems were blackened as if by fire where the hooves had
fallen. Plainly were the marks imprinted, like the tracks of a great
company of horses, in all the lawns and parterres; but they ceased at
the verge of the gardens. And though everyone believed that the
visitation had come from Namirrha, there was no proof of this in the
grounds that fronted the sorcerer's abode; for here the turf was
untrodden.</p>

<p><q>A pox upon Namirrha, if he has done this!</q> cried
Zotulla. <q>For what harm have I ever done him? Verily, I shall set my
heel on the dog's neck; and the torture-wheel shall serve him even as
these horses from Hell have served my blood-red lilies of Sotar and my
vein-colored irises of Naat and my orchids from Uccastrog which were
purple as the bruises of love. Yea, though he stand the viceroy of
Thasaidon above Earth, and overlord of ten thousand devils, my wheel
shall break him, and fires shall heat the wheel white-hot in its
turning, till he withers black as the seared blossoms.</q> Thus did
Zotulla make his brag; but he issued no orders for the execution of
his threat; and no man stirred from the palace towards Namirrha's
house. And from the portals of the wizard none came forth; or if any
came there was no visible sign or sound.</p>

<p>So the day went over, and the night rose, bringing later a moon
that was slightly darkened at the rim. And the night was silent; and
Zotulla, sitting long at the banquet-table, drained his wine-cup often
and wrathfully, muttering new threats against Namirrha. And the night
wore on, and it seemed that the visitation would not be repeated. But
at midnight, lying in his chamber with Obexah, and fathom-deep in his
slumber from the wine, Zotulla was awakened by a monstrous clangor of
hooves that raced and capered in the palace porticoes and in the long
balconies. All night the hooves thundered back and forth, echoing
awfully in the vaulted stone, while Zotulla and Obexah, listening,
huddled close amid their cushions and coverlets; and all the occupants
of the palace, wakeful and fearful, heard the noise but stirred not
from their chambers. A little before dawn the hooves departed
suddenly; and afterward, by day, their marks were found found on the
marble flags of the porches and balconies; and the marks were
countless, deep-graven, and black as if branded there by flame.</p>

<p>Like mottled marble were the emperor's cheeks when he saw the
hoof-printed floors; and terror stayed with him henceforth, following
him to the depths of his inebriety, since he knew not where the
haunting would cease. His women murmured and some wished to flee from
Ummaos, and it seemed that the revels of the day and evening were
shadowed by ill wings that left their umbrage in the yellow wine and
bedimmed the aureate lamps. And again, toward midnight, the slumber of
Zotulla was broken by the hooves, which came galloping and pacing on
the palace-roof and through all the corridors and the
halls. Thereafter, till dawn, the hooves filled the palace with their
iron clatterings, and they rung hollowly on the topmost domes, as if
the coursers of gods had trodden there, passing from heaven to heaven
in tumultuous cavalcade.</p>

<p>Zotulla and Obexah, lying together while the terrible hooves went
to and fro in the hall outside their chamber, had no heart or thought
for sin, nor could they find any comfort in their nearness. In the
gray hour before dawn they heard a great thundering high on the barred
brazen door of the room, as if some mighty stallion, rearing, had
drummed there with his forefeet. And soon after this, the hooves went
away, leaving a silence like an interlude in some gathering storm of
doom. Later, the marks of the hooves were found everywhere in the
halls, marring the bright mosaics. Black holes were burnt in the
golden-threaded rugs and the rugs of silver and scarlet; and the high
white domes were pitted pox-wise with the marks; and far up on the
brazen door of Zotulla's chamber the prints of a horse's forefeet were
incised deeply.</p>

<p>Now, in Ummaos, and throughout Xylac, the tale of this haunting
became known, and the thing was deemed an ominous prodigy, though
people differed in their interpretations. Some held that the sending
came from Namirrha, and was meant as a token of his supremacy above
all kings and emperors; and some thought that it came from a new
wizard who had risen in Tinarath, far to the east, and who wished to
supplant Namirrha. And the priests of the gods of Xylac held that
their various deities had dispatched the haunting, as a sign that more
sacrifices were required in the temples.</p>

<p>Then, in his hall of audience, whose floor of sard and jasper had
been grievously pocked by the unseen hooves, Zotulla called together
many priests and magicians and soothsayers, and asked them to declare
the cause of the sending and devise a mode of exorcism. But, seeing
that there was no agreement among them, Zotulla provided the several
priestly sects with the wherewithal of sacrifice to their sundry gods,
and sent them away; and the wizards and prophets, under threat of
decapitation if they refused, were enjoined to visit Namirrha in his
mansion of sorcery and learn his will, if haply the sending were his
and not the work of another.</p>

<p>Loth were the wizards and the soothsayers, fearing Namirrha, and
caring not to intrude upon the frightful mysteries of his obscure
mansion. But the swordsmen of the emperor drove them forth, lifting
great crescent blades against them when they tarried; so one by one,
in a straggling order, the delegation went towards Namirrha's portals
and vanished into the devil-builded house.</p>

<p>Pale, muttering and distraught, like men who have looked upon hell
and have seen their doom, they returned before sunset to the
emperor. And they said that Namirrha had received them courteously and
had sent them back with this message:</p>

<p><q>Be it known to Zotulla that the haunting is a sign of that which
he has long forgotten; and the reason of the haunting will be revealed
to him at the hour prepared and set apart by destiny. And the hour
draws near: for Namirrha bids the emperor and all his court to a great
feast on the afternoon of the morrow.</q></p>

<p>Having delivered this message, to the wonder and consternation of
Zotulla, the delegation begged his leave to depart. And though the
emperor questioned them minutely, they seemed unwilling to relate the
circumstances of the visit to Namirrha; nor would they describe the
sorcerer's fabled house, except in a vague manner, each contradicting
the other as to what he had seen. So, after a little, Zotulla bade
them go, and when they had gone he sat musing for a long while on the
invitation of Namirrha, which was a thing he cared not to accept but
feared to decline. That evening he drank even more liberally than was
his wont; and he slept a Lethean slumber, nor was there any noise of
trampling hooves about the palace to awaken him. And silently, during
the night, the prophets and magicians passed like furtive shadows from
Ummaos; and no man saw them depart; and at morning they were gone from
Xylac into other lands, never to return....</p>

<p>Now, on that same evening, in the great hall of his house, Namirrha
sat alone, having dismissed the familiars who attended him
ordinarily. Before him, on an altar of jet, was the dark, gigantic
statue of Thasaidon which a devil-begotten sculptor had wrought in
ancient days for an evil king of Tasuun, called Pharnoc. The archdemon
was depicted in the guise of a full-armored warrior, lifting a spiky
mace as if in heroic battle. Long had the statue lain in the
desert-sunken palace of Pharnoc, whose very site was disputed by the
nomads; and Namirrha, by his divination, had found it and had reared
up the infernal image to abide with him always thereafter. And often,
through the mouth of the statue, Thasaidon would utter oracles to
Namirrha, or would answer interrogations.</p>

<p>Before the black-armored image there hung seven silver lamps,
wrought in the form of horses' skulls, with flames issuing changeably
in blue and purple and crimson from their eye-sockets. Wild and lurid
was their light, and the face of the demon, peering from under his
crested helmet, was filled with malign, equivocal shadows that shifted
and changed eternally. And sitting in his serpent-carven chair,
Namirrha regarded the statue grimly, with a deep-furrowed frown
between his eyes: for he had asked a certain thing of Thasaidon, and
the fiend, replying through the statue, had refused him. And rebellion
was in the heart of Namirrha, grown mad with pride, and deeming
himself the lord of all sorcerers and a ruler by his own right among
the princes of devildom. So, after long pondering, he repeated his
request in a bold and haughty voice, like one who addresses an equal
rather than the all-formidable suzerain to whom he had sworn a fatal
fealty.</p>

<p><q>I have helped you heretofore in all things,</q> said the image,
with stony and sonorous accents that were echoed metallically in the
seven silver lamps. <q>Yea, the undying worms of fire and darkness
have come forth like an army at your summons, and the wings of nether
genii have risen to occlude the sun when you called them. But, verily,
I will not aid you in this vengeance you have planned: for the emperor
Zotulla has done me no wrong and has served me well though
unwittingly; and the people of Xylac, by reason of their turpitudes,
are not the least of my terrestial worshippers. Therefore, Namirrha,
it were well for you to live in peace with Zotulla, and well to forget
this olden wrong that was done to the beggar-boy Narthos. For the ways
of destiny are strange, and the workings of its laws sometimes hidden;
and truly, if the hooves of Zotulla's palfrey had not spurned you and
trodden you under, your life had been otherwise, and the name and
renown of Namirrha had still slept in oblivion as a dream
undreamed. Yea, you would tarry still as a beggar in Ummaos, content
with a beggar's guerdon, and would never have fared forth to become
the pupil of the wise and learned Ouphaloc; and I, Thasaidon, would
have lost the lordliest of all necromancers who have accepted my
service and my bond. Think well, Namirrha, and ponder these matters:
for both of us, it would seem, are indebted to Zotulla in all
gratitude for the trampling he gave you.</q></p>

<p><q>Yea, there is a debt,</q> Namirrha growled implacably. <q>And
truly I will pay the debt tomorrow, even as I have planned.... There
are Those who will aid me, Those who will answer my summoning in your
despite.</q></p>

<p><q>It is an ill thing to affront me,</q> said the image, after an
interval. <q>And also, it is not wise to call upon Those that you
designate. However, I perceive clearly that such is your intent. You
are proud and stubborn and revengeful. Do then, as you will, but blame
me not for the outcome.</q></p>

<p>So, after this, there was silence in the hall where Namirrha sat
before the eidolon; and the flames burned darkly, with changeable
colors, in the skull-shapen lamps; and the shadows fled and returned,
unresting, on the face of the statue and the face of Namirrha. Then,
toward midnight, the necromancer arose and went upward by many spiral
stairs to a high dome of his house in which there was a single small
round window that looked forth on the constellations. The window was
set in the top of the dome; but Namirrha had contrived, by means of
his magic, that one entering by the last spiral of the stairs would
suddenly seem to descend rather than climb, and, reaching the last
step, would peer downward through the window while stars passed under
him in a giddying gulf. There, kneeling, Namirrha touched a secret
spring in the marble, and the circular pane slid back without
sound. Then, lying prone on the interior of the dome, with his face
over the abyss, and his long beard trailing stiffly into space, he
whispered a pre-human rune, and held speech with certain entities who
belonged neither to Hell nor the mundane elements, and were more
fearsome to invoke than the infernal genii or the devils of earth,
air, water, and flame. With them he made his contract, defying
Thasaidon's will, while the air curdled about him with their voices,
and rime gathered palely on his sable beard from the cold that was
wrought by their breathing as they leaned earthward.</p>

<p>Laggard and loth was the awakening of Zotulla from his wine; and
quickly, ere he opened his eyes, the daylight was poisoned for him by
the thought of that invitation which he feared to accept or
decline. But he spoke to Obexah, saying:</p>

<p><q>Who, after all, is this wizardly dog, that I should obey his
summons like a beggar called in from the street by some haughty
lord?</q></p>

<p>Obexah, a golden-skinned and oblique-eyed girl from Uccastrog, Isle
of the Torturers, eyed the emperor subtly, and said:</p>

<p><q>O Zotulla, it is yours to accept or refuse, as you deem
fitting. And truly, it is a small matter for the lord of Ummaos and
all Xylac, whether to go or to stay, since naught can impugn his
sovereignty. Therefore, were it not as well to go?</q> For Obexah,
though fearful of the wizard, was curious regarding that devil-builded
house of which so little was known; and likewise, in the manner of
women, she wished to behold the famed Namirrha, whose mien and
appearance were still but a far-brought legend in Ummaos.</p>

<p><q>There is something in what you say,</q> admitted Zotulla. <q>But
an emperor, in his conduct, must always consider the public good; and
there are matters of state involved, which a woman can scarcely be
expected to understand.</q></p>

<p>So, later in the forenoon, after an ample and well-irrigated
breakfast, he called his chamberlains and courtiers about him and took
counsel with them. And some advised him to ignore the invitation of
Namirrha; and others held that the invitation be accepted, lest a
graver evil than the trampling of ghostly hooves be sent upon the
palace and the city.</p>

<p>Then Zotulla called the many priesthoods before him in a body, and
sought to resummon the wizards and soothsayers who had fled privily in
the night. Among all the latter, there was none who answered the
crying of his name through Ummaos; and this aroused a certain
wonder. But the priests came in a greater number than before, and
thronged the hall of audience so that the paunches of the foremost
were straightened against the imperial dais and the buttocks of the
hindmost were flattened on the rear walls and pillars. And Zotulla
debated with them the matter of acceptance or refusal. And the priests
argued, as before, that Namirrha was nowherewise concerned with the
sending ; and his invitation, they said, portended no harm nor bale to
the emperor; and it was plain, from the terms of the message, that an
oracle would be imparted to Zotulla by the wizard; and this oracle, if
Namirrha were a true archimage, would confirm their own holy wisdom
and re&euml;stablish the divine source of the sending; and the gods of
Xylac would again be glorified.</p>

<p>Then, having heard the pronouncement of the priests, the emperor
instructed his treasurers to load them down with new offerings; and
calling unctuously upon Zotulla and all his household the vicarious
blessings of the several gods, the priests departed. And the day wore
on, and the sun passed its meridian, falling slowly beyond Ummaos
through the spaces of the afternoon that were floored with sea-ending
deserts. And still Zotulla was irresolute; and he called his
wine-bearers, bidding them pour for him the strongest and most
magistral of their vintages; but in the wine he found neither
certitude nor decision.</p>

<p>Sitting still on his throne in the hall of audience, he heard,
toward middle afternoon, a mighty and clamorous outcry that arose at
the palace portals. There were deep wailings of men and the shrillings
of eunuchs and women, as if terror passed from tongue to tongue,
invading the halls and apartments. And the fearful clamor spread
throughout all the palace, and Zotulla, rousing from the lethargy of
wine, was about to send his attendants to inquire the cause.</p>

<p>Then, into the hall, there filed an array of tall mummies, clad in
royal cerements of purple and scarlet, and wearing gold crowns on
their withered craniums. And after them, like servitors, came gigantic
skeletons who wore loin-cloths of nacarat orange and about whose upper
skulls, from brow to crown, live serpents of banded saffron and ebon
had wrapped themselves for head-dresses. And the mummies bowed before
Zotulla, saying with thin, sere voices:</p>

<p><q>We, who were kings of the wide realm of Tasuun aforetime, have
been sent as a guard of honor for the emperor Zotulla, to attend him
as is befitting when he goes forth to the feast prepared by
Namirrha.</q></p>

<p>Then with dry clickings of their teeth, and whistlings as of air
through screens of fretted ivory, the skeletons spoke:</p>

<p><q>We, who were giant warriors of a race forgotten, have also been
sent by Namirrha, so that the emperor's household, following him to
the feast, should be guarded from all peril and should fare forth in
such pageantry as is meet and proper.</q></p>

<p>Witnessing these prodigies, the wine-bearers and other attendants
cowered about the imperial dais or hid behind the pillars, while
Zotulla, with pupils swimming starkly in a bloodshot white, with face
bloated and ghastly pale, sat frozen on his throne and could utter no
word in reply to the ministers of Namirrha.</p>

<p>Then, coming forward, the mummies said in dusty accents: <q>All is
made ready, and the feast awaits the arrival of Zotulla.</q> And the
cerements of the mummies stirred and fell open at the bosom, and small
rodent monsters, brown as bitumen, eyed as with accursed rubies,
reared forth from the eaten hearts of the mummies like rats from their
holes and chittered shrilly in human speech, repeating the words. The
skeletons in turn took up the solemn sentence; and the black and
saffron serpents hissed it from their skulls; and the words were
repeated lastly in baleful rumblings by certain furry creatures of
dubious form, hitherto unseen by Zotulla, who sat behind the ribs of
the skeletons as if in cages of white wicker.</p>

<p>Like a dreamer who obeys the doom of dreams, the emperor rose from
his throne and went forward, and the mummies surrounded him like an
escort. And each of the skeletons drew from the reddish-yellow folds
of his loin-cloth a curiously pierced archaic flute of silver; and all
began a sweet and evil and deathly fluting as the emperor went out
through the halls of the palace. A fatal spell was in the music: for
the chamberlains, the women, the guards, the eunuchs, and all members
of Zotulla's household even to the cooks and scullions, were drawn
like a procession of night-walkers from the rooms and alcoves in which
they had vainly hidden themselves; and marshaled by the flutists, they
followed after Zotulla. A strange thing it was to behold this mighty
company of people, going forth in the slanted sunlight toward
Namirrha's house, with a cort&egrave;ge of dead kings about them, and
the blown breath of skeletons thrilling eldritchly in the silver
flutes. And little was Zotulla comforted when he found the girl Obexah
at his side, moving, as he, in a thralldom of involitent horror, with
the rest of his women close behind.</p>

<p>Coming to the open portals of Namirrha's house, the emperor saw
that they were guarded by great crimson-wattled things, half dragon,
half man, who bowed before him, sweeping their wattles like bloody
besoms on the flags of dark onyx. And the emperor passed with Obexah
between the louting monsters, with the mummies, the skeletons and his
own people behind him in strange pageant, and entered a vast and
multicolumned hall, where the daylight, following timidly, was drowned
by the baleful arrogant blaze of a thousand lamps.</p>

<p>Even amid his horror, Zotulla marvelled at the vastness of the
chamber, which he could hardly reconcile with the mansion's outer
length and height and breadth, though these indeed were of most
palatial amplitude. For it seemed that he gazed down great avenues of
topless pillars, and vistas of tables laden with piled-up viands and
thronged urns of wine, that stretched away before him into luminous
distance and gloom as of starless night.</p>

<p>In the wide intervals between the tables, the familiars of Namirrha
and his other servants went to and fro incessantly, as if a
fantasmagoria of ill dreams were embodied before the emperor. Kingly
cadavers in robes of time-rotted brocade, with worms seething in their
eye-pits, poured a blood-like wine into cups of the opalescent horn of
unicorns. Lamias, trident-tailed, and four-breasted chimeras, came in
with fuming platters lifted high by their brazen claws. Dog-headed
devils, tongued with lolling flames, ran forward to offer themselves
as ushers for the company. And before Zotulla and Obexah, there
appeared a curious being with the full-fleshed lower limbs and hips of
a great black woman and the clean-picked bones of some titanic ape
from thereupward.</p>

<p>Verily, it seemed to Zotulla that they had gone a long way into
some malignly litten cavern of Hell, when they came to that
perspective of tables and columns down which the monster had led
them. Here, at the room's end, apart from the rest, was a table at
which Namirrha sat alone, with the flames of the seven horse-skull
lamps burning restlessly behind him, and the mailed black image of
Thasaidon towering from the altar of jet at his right hand. And a
little aside from the altar, a diamond mirror was upborne by the claws
of iron basilisks.</p>

<p>Namirrha rose to greet them, observing a solemn and funereal
courtesy. His eyes were bleak and cold as distant stars in the hollows
wrought by strange fearful vigils. His lips were like a pale-red seal
on a shut parchment of doom. His beard flowed stiffly in
black-anointed banded locks across the bosom of his vermilion robe,
like a mass of straight black serpents. Zotulla felt the blood pause
and thicken about his heart, as if congealing into ice. And Obexah,
peering beneath lowered lids, was abashed and frightened by the
visible horror that invested this man and hung upon him even as
royalty upon a king. But amid her fear, she found room to wonder what
manner of man he was in his intercourse with women.</p>

<p><q>I bid you welcome, O Zotulla, to such hospitality as is mine to
offer,</q> said Namirrha, with the iron ringing of some hidden
funereal bell deep down in his hollow voice. <q>Prithee, be seated at
my table.</q></p>

<p>Zotulla saw that a chair of ebony had been placed for him opposite
Namirrha; and another chair, less stately and imperial, had been
placed at the left hand for Obexah. And the twain seated themselves;
and Zotulla saw that his people were sitting likewise at other tables
throughout the huge hall, with the frightful servants of Namirrha
waiting upon them busily, like devils attending the damned.</p>

<p>Then Zotulla perceived that a dark and corpse-like hand was pouring
wine for him in a crystal cup; and upon the hand was the signet-ring
of the emperors of Xylac, set with a monstrous fire-opal in the mouth
of a golden bat: even such a ring as Zotulla wore perpetually on his
index-finger. And, turning, he beheld at his right hand a figure that
bore the likeness of his father, Pithaim, after the poison of the
adder, spreading through his limbs, had left behind it the purple
bloating of death. And Zotulla, who had caused the adder to be placed
in the bed of Pithaim, cowered in his seat and trembled with a guilty
fear. And the thing that wore the similtude of Pithaim, whether corpse
or an image wrought by Namirrha's enchantment, came and went at
Zotulla's elbow, waiting upon him with stark, black, swollen fingers
that never fumbled. Horribly he was aware of its bulging, unregarding
eyes, and its livid purple mouth that was locked in a rigor of mortal
silence, and the spotted adder that peered at intervals with chill
orbs from its heavy-folded sleeve as it leaned beside him to replenish
his cup or to serve him with meat. And dimly, through the icy mist of
his terror, the emperor beheld the shadowy-armored shape, like a
moving replica of the still, grim statue of Thasaidon, which Namirrha
had reared up in his blasphemy to perform the same office for
himself. And vaguely, without comprehension, he saw the dreadful
ministrant that hovered beside Obexah: a flayed and eyeless corpse in
the image of her first lover, a boy from Cyntrom who had been cast
ashore in shipwreck on the Isle of the Torturers. There Obexah had
found him, lying behind the ebbing wave, and reviving the boy, she had
hidden him awhile in a secret cave for her own pleasure, and had
brought him food and drink. Later, wearying, she had betrayed him to
the Torturers, and had taken a new delight in the various pangs and
ordeals inflicted upon him before death by that cruel, pernicious
people.</p>

<p><q>Drink,</q> said Namirrha, quaffing a strange wine that was red
and dark as if with disastrous sunsets of lost years. And Zotulla and
Obexah drank the wine, feeling no warmth in their veins thereafter,
but a chill as of hemlock mounting slowly toward the heart.</p>

<p><q>Verily, 'tis a good wine,</q> said Namirrha, and a proper one in
which to toast the furthering of our acquaintance: for it was buried
long ago with the royal dead, in amphorae of somber jasper shapen like
funeral urns; and my ghouls found it, whenas they came to dig in
Tasuun.</p>

<p>Now it seemed that the tongue of Zotulla froze in his mouth, as a
mandrake freezes in the rime-bound soil of winter; and he found no
reply to Namirrha's courtesy.</p>

<p><q>Prithee, make trial of this meat,</q> quoth Namirrha, <q>for it
is very choice, being the flesh of that boar which the Torturers of
Uccastrog are wont to pasture on the well-minced leavings of their
wheels and racks; and, moreover, my cooks have spiced it with the
powerful balsams of the tomb, and have farced it with the hearts of
adders and the tongues of black cobras.</q></p>

<p>Naught could the emperor say; and even Obexah was silent, being
sorely troubled in her turpitude by the presence of that flayed and
piteous thing which had the likeness of her lover from Cyntrom. And
the dread of the necromancer grew prodigiously; for his knowledge of
this old, forgotten crime, and the raising of the fantasm, appeared to
her a more baleful magic than all else.</p>

<p><q>Now, I fear,</q> said Namirrha, <q>that you find the meat devoid
of savor, and the wine without fire. So, to enliven our feasting, I
shall call forth my singers and my musicians.</q></p>

<p>He spoke a word unknown to Zotulla or Obexah, which sounded
throughout the mighty hall as if a thousand voices in turn had taken
it up and prolonged it. Anon there appeared the singers, who were
she-ghouls with shaven bodies and hairy shanks, and long yellow tushes
full of shredded carrion curving across their chaps from mouths that
fawned hyena-wise on the company. Behind them entered the musicians,
some of whom were male devils pacing erect on the hind-quarters of
sable stallions and plucking with the fingers of white apes at lyres
of the bone and sinew of cannibals from Naat; and others were pied
satyrs puffing their goatish cheeks at hautboys formed from the
bosom-skin of Negro queens and the horn of rhinoceri.</p>

<p>They bowed before Namirrha with grotesque ceremony. Then, without
delay, the she-ghouls began a most dolorous and execrable howling, as
of jackals that have sniffed their carrion; and the satyrs and devils
played a lament that was like the moaning of desert-born winds through
forsaken palace harems. And Zotulla shivered, for the singing filled
his marrow with ice, and the music left in his heart a desolation as
of empires fallen and trod under by the iron-shod hooves of
time. Ever, amid that evil music, he seemed to hear the sifting of
sand across withered gardens, and the windy rustling of rotted silks
upon couches of bygone luxury, and the hissing of coiled serpents from
the low fusts of shattered columns. And the glory that had been Ummaos
seemed to pass away like the blown pillars of the simoom.</p>

<p><q>Now that was a brave tune,</q> said Namirrha when the music
ceased and the she-ghouls no longer howled. <q>But verily I fear that
you find my entertainment somewhat dull. Therefore, my dancers shall
dance for you.</q></p>

<p>He turned toward the great hall, and described in the air an
enigmatic sign with the fingers of his right hand. In answer to the
sign, a hueless mist came down from the high roof and hid the room
like a fallen curtain for a brief interim. There was a babel of
sounds, confused and muffled, beyond the curtain, and a crying of
voices faint as if with distance.</p>

<p>Then, dreadfully, the vapor rolled away, and Zotulla saw that the
leaden tables had gone. In the wide interspaces of the columns, his
palace-inmates, the chamberlains, the eunuchs, the courtiers and
odalisques and all the others, lay trussed with thongs on the floor,
like so many fowls of glorious plumage. Above them, in time to a music
made by the lyrists and flutists of the necromancer, a troupe of
skeletons pirouetted with light clickings of their toe-bones; and a
rout of mummies bowed stiffly; and others of Namirrha's creatures
moved with mysterious caperings. To and fro they leapt on the bodies
of the emperor's people, in the paces of an evil saraband. At every
step they grew taller and heavier, till the saltant mummies were as
the mummies of Anakim, and the skeletons were boned as colossi; and
louder the music rose, drowning the faint cries of Zotulla's
people. And huger still became the dancers, towering far into vaulted
shadow among the vast columns, with thudding feet that wrought thunder
in the room; and those whereon they danced were as grapes trampled for
a vintage in autumn; and the floor ran deep with a sanguine must.</p>

<p>As a man drowning in a noisome, night-bound fen, the emperor heard
the voice of Namirrha:</p>

<p><q>It would seem that my dancers please you not. So now I shall
present you a most royal spectacle. Arise and follow me, for the
spectacle is one that requires an empire for its stage.</q></p>

<p>Zotulla and Obexah rose from their chairs in the fashion of
night-walkers. Giving no backward glance at their ministering
phantoms, or the hall where the dancers bounded, they followed
Namirrha to an alcove beyond the altar of Thasaidon. Thence, by the
upward-coiling stairways, they came at length to a broad high balcony
that faced Zotulla's palace and looked forth above the city roofs
toward the bourn of sunset.</p>

<p>It seemed that several hours had gone by in that hellish feasting
and entertainment; for the day was near to its close, and the sun,
which had fallen from sight behind the imperial palace, was barring
the vast heavens with bloody rays.</p>

<p><q>Behold,</q> said Namirrha, adding a strange vocable to which the
stone of the edifice resounded like a beaten gong.</p>

<p>The balcony pitched a little, and Zotulla, looking over the
balustrade, beheld the roofs of Ummaos lessen and sink beneath him. It
seemed that the balcony flew skyward to a prodigious height, and he
peered down across the domes of his own palace, upon the houses, the
tilled fields and the desert beyond, and the huge sun brought low on
the desert's verge. And Zotulla grew giddy; and the chill airs of the
upper heavens blew upon him. But Namirrha spoke another word, and the
balcony ceased to ascend.</p>

<p><q>Look well,</q> said the necromancer, <q>on the empire that was
yours, but shall be yours no longer.</q> Then, with arms outstretched
toward the sunset, he called aloud the twelve names that were
perdition to utter, and after them the tremendous invocation: <em>Gna
padambis devompra thungis furidor avoragomon.</em></p>

<p>Instantly, it seemed that great ebon clouds of thunder beetled
against the sun. Lining the horizon, the clouds took the form of
colossal monsters with heads and members somewhat resembling those of
stallions. Rearing terribly, they trod down the sun like an
extinguished ember; and racing as if in some hippodrome of Titans,
they rose higher and vaster, coming towards Ummaos. Deep, calamitous
rumblings preceded them, and the earth shook visibly, till Zotulla saw
that these were not immaterial clouds, but actual living forms that
had come forth to tread the world in macrocosmic vastness. Throwing
their shadows for many leagues before them, the coursers charged as if
devil-ridden into Xylac, and their feet descended like falling
mountain crags upon far oases and towns of the outer wastes.</p>

<p>Like a many-turreted storm they came, and it seemed that the world
shrank gulfward, tilting beneath the weight. Still as a man enchanted
into marble, Zotulla stood and beheld the ruining that was wrought on
his empire. And closer drew the gigantic stallions, racing with
inconceivable speed, and louder was the thundering of their footfalls,
that now began to blot the green fields and fruited orchards lying for
many miles to the west of Ummaos. And the shadow of the stallions
climbed like an evil gloom of eclipse, till it covered Ummaos; and
looking up, the emperor saw their eyes halfway between earth and
zenith, like baleful suns that glare down from soaring cumuli.</p>

<p>Then, in the thickening gloom, above that insupportable thunder, he
heard the voice of Namirrha, crying in mad triumph:</p>

<p><q>Know, Zotulla, that I have called up the coursers of
Thamogorgos, lord of the abyss. And the coursers will tread your
empire down, even as your palfrey trod and trampled in former time a
beggar-boy named Narthos. And learn also that I, Namirrha, was that
boy.</q> And the eyes of Namirrha, filled with a vainglory of madness
and bale, burned like malign, disastrous stars at the hour of their
culmination.</p>

<p>To Zotulla, wholly mazed with the horror and tumult, the
necromancer's words were no more than shrill, shrieked overtones of
the tempest of doom; and he understood them not. Tremendously, with a
rending of staunch-built roofs, and an instant cleavage and crumbling
down of mighty masonries, the hooves descended upon Ummaos. Fair
temple-domes were pashed like shells of the haliotis, and haughty
mansions were broken and stamped into the ground even as gourds; and
house by house the city was trampled flat with a crashing as of worlds
beaten into chaos. Far below, in the darkened streets, men and camels
fled like scurrying emmets but could not escape. And implacably the
hooves rose and fell, till ruin was upon half the city, and night was
over all. The palace of Zotulla was trodden under, and now the
forelegs of the coursers loomed level with Namirrha's balcony, and
their heads towered awfully above. It seemed that they would rear and
trample down the necromancer's house; but at that moment they parted
to left and right, and a dolorous glimmering came from the low sunset;
and the coursers went on, treading under them that portion of Ummaos
which lay to the eastward. And Zotulla and Obexah and Namirrha looked
down on the city's fragments as on a shard-strewn midden, and heard
the cataclysmic clamor of the hooves departing toward eastern
Xylac.</p>

<p><q>Now that was a goodly spectacle,</q> quoth Namirrha. Then,
turning to the emperor, he added malignly: <q>Think not that I have
done with thee, however, or that doom is yet consummate.</q></p>

<p>It seemed that the balcony had fallen to its former elevation,
which was still a lofty vantage above the sharded ruins. And Namirrha
plucked the emperor by the arm and led him from the balcony to an
inner chamber, while Obexah followed mutely. The emperor's heart was
crushed within him by the trampling of such calamities, and despair
weighed upon him like a foul incubus on the shoulders of a man lost in
some land of accursed night. And he knew not that he had been parted
from Obexah on the threshold of the chamber, and that certain of
Namirrha's creatures, appearing like shadows, had compelled the girl
to go downward with them by the stairs, and had stifled her outcries
with their rotten cerements as they went.</p>

<p>The chamber was one that Namirrha used for his most unhallowed
rites and alchemies. The rays of the lamps that illumed it were
saffron-red like the spilt ichor of devils, and they flowed on aludels
and crucibles and black athanors and alembics whereof the purpose was
hardly to be named by mortal man. The sorcerer heated in one of the
alembics a dark liquid full of star-cold lights, while Zotulla looked
on unheeding. And when the liquid bubbled and sent forth a spiral
vapor, Namirrha distilled it into goblets of gold-rimmed iron, and
gave one of the goblets to Zotulla and retained the other himself. And
he said to Zotulla with a stern imperative voice: <q>I bid thee quaff
this liquor.</q></p>

<p>Zotulla, fearing that the draft was poison, hesitated. And the
necromancer regarded him with a lethal gaze, and cried
loudly: <q>Fearest thou to do as I?</q> and therewith he set the
goblet to his lips.</p>

<p>So the emperor drank the draft, constrained as if by the bidding of
some angel of death, and a darkness fell upon his senses. But, ere the
darkness grew complete, he saw that Namirrha had drained his own
goblet.</p>

<p>Then, with unspeakable agonies, it seemed that the emperor died;
and his soul float free; and again he saw the chamber, though with
bodiless eyes. And discarnate he stood in the saffron-crimson light,
with his body lying as if dead on the floor beside him, and near it
the prone body of Namirrha and the two fallen goblets.</p>

<p>Standing thus, he beheld a strange thing: for anon his own body
stirred and arose, while that of the necromancer remained still as
death. And Zotulla looked at his own lineaments and his figure in its
short cloak of azure samite sewn with black pearls and balas-rubies;
and the body lived before him, though with eyes that held a darker
fire and a deeper evil than was their wont. Then, without corporeal
ears, Zotulla heard the figure speak, and the voice was the strong,
arrogant voice of Namirrha, saying:</p>

<p><q>Follow me, O houseless phantom, and do in all things as I enjoin
thee.</q></p>

<p>Like an unseen shadow, Zotulla followed the wizard, and the twain
went downward by the stairs to the great banquet hall. They came to
the altar of Thasaidon and the mailed image, with the seven
horse-skull lamps burning before it as formerly. Upon the altar,
Zotulla's beloved leman Obexah, who alone of all women had power to
stir his sated heart, was lying bound with thongs at Thasaidon's
feet. But the hall beyond was deserted, and nothing remained of that
Saturnalia of doom except the fruit of the treading, which had flowed
together in dark pools among the columns.</p>

<p>Namirrha, using the emperor's body in all ways for his own, paused
before the dark eidolon; and he said to the spirit of Zotulla: <q>Be
imprisoned in this image, without power to free thyself or to stir in
any wise.</q></p>

<p>Being wholly obedient to the will of the necromancer, the soul of
Zotulla was embodied in the statue, and he felt its cold, gigantic
armor about him like a straight sarcophagus, and he peered forth
immovably from the bleak eyes that were overhung by its carven
helmet.</p>

<p>Gazing thus, he beheld the change that had come on his own body
through the sorcerous possession of Namirrha: for below the short
azure cloak, the legs had turned suddenly to the hind legs of a black
stallion, with hooves that glowed redly as if heated by infernal
fires. And even as Zotulla watched this prodigy, the hooves glowed
white and incandescent, and fumes mounted from the floor beneath
them.</p>

<p>Then, on the black altar, the hybrid abomination came pacing
haughtily toward Obexah, and smoking footprints appeared behind it as
it came. Pausing beside the girl, who lay supine and helpless
regarding it with eyes that were pools of frozen horror, it raised one
glowing hoof and set the hoof on her naked bosom between the small
breast-cups of golden filigree begemmed with rubies. And the girl
screamed beneath that atrocious treading as the soul of one newly
damned might scream in hell; and the hoof glared with intolerable
brilliance, as if freshly plucked from a furnace wherein the weapons
of demons were forged.</p>

<p>At that moment, in the cowed and crushed and sodden shade of the
emperor Zotulla, close-locked within the adamantine image, there awoke
the manhood that had slumbered unaroused before the ruining of his
empire and the trampling of his retinue. Immediately a great
abhorrence and a high wrath were alive in his soul, and mightily he
longed for his own right arm to serve him, and a sword in his right
hand.</p>

<p>Then it seemed that a voice spoke within him, chill and bleak and
awful, and as if uttered inwardly by the statue itself. And the voice
said: <q>I am Thasaidon, lord of the seven hells beneath the earth,
and the hells of man's heart above the earth, which are seven times
seven. For the moment, O Zotulla, my power is become thine for the
sake of a mutual vengeance. Be one in all ways with the statue that
has my likeness, even as the soul is one with the flesh. Behold! there
is a mace of adamant in thy right hand. Lift up the mace, and
smite.</q></p>

<p>Zotulla was aware of a great power within him, and giant thews
about him that thrilled with the power and responded agilely to his
will. He felt in his mailed right hand the haft of the huge
spiky-headed mace; and though the mace was beyond the lifting of any
man in mortal flesh, it seemed no more than a goodly weight to
Zotulla. Then, rearing he mace like a warrior in battle, he struck
down with one crashing blow the impious thing that wore his own
rightful flesh united with the legs and hooves of a demon courser. And
the thing crumpled swiftly down and lay with the brain spreading
pulpily from its shattered skull on the shining jet. And the legs
twitched a little and then grew still; and the hooves glowed from a
fiery, blinding white to the redness of red-hot iron, cooling
slowly.</p>

<p>For a space there was no sound, other than the shrill screaming of
the girl Obexah, mad with pain and the terror of those prodigies which
she had beheld. Then in the soul of Zotulla, grown sick with that
screaming, the chill, awful voice of Thasaidon spoke again:</p>

<p><q>Go free, for there is nothing more for thee to do.</q> So the
spirit of Zotulla passed from the image of Thasaidon and found in the
wide air the freedom of nothingness and oblivion.</p>

<p>But the end was not yet for Namirrha, whose mad, arrogant soul had
been loosened from Zotulla's body by the blow, and had returned
darkly, not in the manner planned by the magician, to its own body
lying in the room of accursed rites and forbidden
transmigrations. There Namirrha woke anon, with a dire confusion in
his mind, and a partial forgetfulness: for the curse of Thasaidon was
upon him now because of his blasphemies.</p>

<p>Nothing was clear in his thought except a malign, exorbitant
longing for revenge; but the reason thereof, and the object, were as
doubtful shadows. And still prompted by that obscure animus, he arose;
and girding to his side an enchanted sword with runic sapphires and
opals in the hilt, he descended the stairs and came again to the altar
of Thasaidon, where the mailed statue stood as impassive as before,
with the poised mace in its immovable right hand, and below it, on the
altar, the double sacrifice.</p>

<p>A veil of weird darkness was upon the senses of Namirrha, and he
saw not the stallion-legged horror that lay dead with slowly
blackening hooves; and he heard not the moaning of the girl Obexah,
who still lived beside it. But his eyes were drawn by the diamond
mirror that was upheld in the claws of black iron basilisks beyond the
altar; and going to the mirror, he saw therein a face that he knew no
longer for his own. And because his eyes were shadowed and his brain
filled with the shifting webs of delusion, he took the face for that
of the emperor Zotulla. Insatiable as Hell's own flame, his old hatred
rose within him; and he drew the enchanted sword and began to hew
therewith at the reflection. Sometimes, because of the curse laid upon
him, and the impious transmigration which he had performed, he thought
himself Zotulla warring with the necromancer; and again, in the
shiftings of his madness, he was Namirrha smiting at the emperor; and
then, without name, he fought a nameless foe. And soon the sorcerous
blade, though tempered with formidable spells, was broken close to the
hilt, and Namirrha beheld the image still unharmed. Then, howling
aloud the half-forgotten runes of a most tremendous curse, made
invalid through his own forgettings, he hammered still with the heavy
sword-hilt on the mirror, till the runic sapphires and opals cracked
in the hilt and fell away at his feet in little fragments.</p>

<p>Obexah, dying on the altar, saw Namirrha battling with his image,
and the spectacle moved her to mad laughter like the pealing of bells
of ruined crystal. And above her laughter, and above the cursings of
Namirrha, there came anon like the rumbling of a swift-driven storm
the thunder made by the macrocosmic stallions of Thamogorgos,
returning gulfward through Xylac over Ummaos, to trample down the one
house that they had spared aforetime.</p>
