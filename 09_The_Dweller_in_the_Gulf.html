  <h1>The Dweller in the Gulf</h1>
  <h2>Clark Ashton Smith</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>Swelling and towering swiftly, like a genie loosed from one of
Solomon's bottles, the cloud rose on the planet's rim. A rusty and
colossal column, it strode above the dead plain, through a sky that
was dark as the brine of desert seas that have ebbed down to desert
pools.</p>

<p><q>Looks like a blithering sandstorm,</q> commented Maspic.</p>

<p><q>It can't very well be anything else,</q> agreed Bellman rather
curtly. <q>Any other kind of storm is unheard of in these
regions. It's the sort of hell-twister that the Aihais call
the <i>zoorth</i>&mdash;and it's coming our way, too. I move that we
start looking for shelter. I've been caught in the <i>zoorth</i>
before, and I don't recommend a lungful of that ferruginous
dust.</q></p>

<p><q>There's a cave in the old river bank, to the right,</q> said
Chivers, the third member of the party, who had been searching the
desert with restless, falconlike eyes.</p>

<p>The trio of earthmen, hard-bitten adventurers who disdained the
services of Martian guides, had started five days before from the
outpost of Ahoom, into the uninhabited region called the Chaur. Here,
in the beds of great rivers that had not flowed for cycles, it was
rumored that the pale, platinum-like gold of Mars could be found lying
in heaps, like so much salt. If fortune were propitious, their years
of somewhat unwilling exile on the red planet would soon be at an
end. They had been warned against the Chaur, and had heard some queer
tales in Ahoom regarding the reasons why former prospectors had not
returned. But danger, no matter how dire or exotic, was merely a part
of their daily routine. With a fair chance of unlimited gold at the
journey's end they would have gone down through Hinnom.</p>

<p>Their food-supplies and water-barrels were carried on the backs of
three of those curious mammals called <i>vortlups</i>, which, with
their elongated legs and necks, and horny-plated bodies, might
seemingly have been some fabulous combination of llama and
saurian. These animals, though extravagantly ugly, were tame and
obedient, and were well adapted to desert travel, being able to go
without water for months at a time.</p>

<p>For the past two days they had followed the mile-wide course of a
nameless ancient river, winding among hills that had dwindled to mere
hummocks through aeons of exfoliation. They had found nothing but worn
boulders, pebbles and fine rusty sand. Heretofore the sky had been
silent and stirless; and nothing moved on the river-bottom, whose
stones were bare even of dead lichen. The malignant column of
the <i>zoorth</i>, twisting and swelling toward them, was the first
sign of animation they had discerned in that lifeless land.</p>

<p>Prodding their <i>vortlups</i> with the iron-pointed goads which
alone could elicit any increase of speed from these sluggish monsters,
the earthmen started off toward the cavern-mouth descried by
Chivers. It was perhaps a third of a mile distant, and was high up in
the shelving shore.</p>

<p>The <i>zoorth</i> had blotted out the sun ere they reached the
bottom of the ancient slope, and they moved through a sinister
twilight that was colored like dried blood. The <i>vortlups</i>,
protesting with unearthly bellows, began to climb the beach, which was
marked off in a series of more or less regular steps that indicated
the slow recession of its olden waters. The column of sand, rising and
whirling formidably, had reached the opposite bank when they came to
the cavern.</p>

<p>This cavern was in the face of a low cliff of iron-veined rock. The
entrance had crumbled down in heaps of ferro-oxide and dark basaltic
dust, but was large enough to admit with ease the earthmen and their
laden beasts of burden. Darkness, heavy as if with a weaving of black
webs, clogged the interior. They could form no idea of the cave's
dimensions till Bellman got out an electric torch from his bale of
belongings and turned its prying beam into the shadows.</p>

<p>The torch served merely to reveal the beginnings of a chamber of
indeterminate size that ran backward into night, widening gradually,
with a floor that was worn smooth as if by vanished waters.</p>

<p>The opening had grown dark with the onset of the <i>zoorth</i>. A
weird moaning as of baffled demons filled the ears of the explorers,
and particles of atomlike sand were blown in upon them, stinging their
hands and faces like powdered adamant.</p>

<p><q>The storm will last for half an hour, at least,</q> said
Bellman. <q>Shall we go on into the cave? Probably we won't find
anything of much interest or value. But the exploration will serve to
kill time. And we might happen on a few violet rubies or amber-yellow
sapphires, such as are sometimes discovered in these desert
caverns. You two had better bring along your torches also, and flash
them on the walls and ground as we go.</q></p>

<p>His companions thought the suggestion worth
following. The <i>vortlups</i>, wholly insensible to the blowing sand
in their scaly mail, were left behind near the entrance. Chivers,
Bellman and Maspic, with their torch-beams tearing a clotted gloom
that had perhaps never known the intrusion of light in all its former
cycles, went on into the widening cave.</p>

<p>The place was bare, with the death-like emptiness of some
long-deserted catacomb. Its rusted floor and walls returned no gleam
or sparkle to the playing lights. It sloped downward at an easy
gradient and the sides were water-marked at a height of six or seven
feet. No doubt it had been in earlier aeons the channel of an
underground offshoot from the river. It had been swept clean of all
detritus, and was like the interior of some Cyclopean conduit that
might give upon a sub-Martian Erebus.</p>

<p>None of the three adventurers was overly imaginative or prone to
nervousness. But all were beset by certain odd impressions. Behind the
arras of cryptic silence, time and again they seemed to hear a faint
whisper, like the sigh of sunken seas far down at some hemispheric
depth. The air was tinged with a slight and doubtful dankness, and
they felt the stirring of an almost imperceptible draft upon their
faces. Oddest of all was the hint of a nameless odor, reminding them
both of animal dens and the peculiar smell of Martian dwellings.</p>

<p><q>Do you suppose well encounter any kind of life?</q> said Maspic,
sniffing the air dubiously.</p>

<p><q>Not likely.</q> Bellman dismissed the query with his usual
curtness. <q>Even the wild <i>vortlups</i> avoid the Chaur.</q></p>

<p><q>But there's certainly a touch of dampness in the air,</q>
persisted Maspic. <q>That means water, somewhere; and if there is
water, there may be life also&mdash;perhaps of a dangerous
kind.</q></p>

<p><q>We've got our revolvers,</q> said Bellman. <q>But I doubt if
we'll need them&mdash;as long as we don't meet any rival gold-hunters
from the Earth,</q> he added cynically.</p>

<p><q>Listen.</q> The semi-whisper came from Chivers. <q>Do you
fellows hear anything?</q></p>

<p>All three had paused. Somewhere in the gloom ahead, they heard a
prolonged, equivocal noise that baffled the ear with incongruous
elements. It was a sharp rustling and rattling as of metal dragged
over rock, and also it was somehow like the smacking of myriad wet,
enormous mouths. Anon it receded and died out at a level that was
seemingly far below.</p>

<p><q>That's queer.</q> Bellman seemed to make a reluctant
admission.</p>

<p><q>What is it?</q> queried Chivers. <q>One of the millipedal
underground monsters, half a mile long, that the Martians tell
about?</q></p>

<p><q>You've been hearing too many native fairy-tales,</q> reproved
Bellman. <q>No terrestrial has ever seen anything of that kind. Many
deep-lying caverns on Mars have been thoroughly explored: but those in
desert regions, such as the Chaur, were devoid of life. I can't
imagine what could have made that noise; but, in the interests of
science, I'd like to go on and find out.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm beginning to feel creepy,</q> said Maspic. <q>But I'm game
if you others are.</q></p>

<p>Without further argument or comment, the three continued their
advance into the cave. They had been walking at a fair gait for
fifteen minutes, and were now at least half a mile from the
entrance. The floor was steepening as if it had been the bed of a
torrent. Also, the conformation of the walls had changed: on either
hand there were high shelves of metallic stone and columnated recesses
which the flashed rays of the torches could not always fathom.</p>

<p>The air had grown heavier, the dampness unmistakable. There was a
breath of stagnant ancient waters. That other smell, as of wild beasts
and Aihai dwellings, also tainted the gloom with its clinging
fetor.</p>

<p>Bellman was leading the way. Suddenly his torch revealed the verge
of a precipice, where the olden channel ended sheerly and the shelves
and walls pitched away on each side into incalculable space. Going to
the very edge, he dipped his pencil of light adown the abyss,
disclosing only the vertical cliff that fell at his feet into darkness
with no apparent bottom. The beam also failed to reach the further
shore of the gulf, which might have been many leagues in extent.</p>

<p><q>Looks as if we had found the original jumping-off place,</q>
observed Chivers. Looking about, he secured a loose lump of rock the
size of a small boulder, which he hurled as far out as he could into
the abysm. The earthmen listened for the sound of its fall; but
several minutes went by, and there was no echo from the black
profound.</p>

<p>Bellman started to examine the broken-off ledges on either side of
the channel's terminus. To the right he discerned a downward-sloping
shelf that skirted the abyss, running for an uncertain distance. Its
beginning was little higher than the channel-fed, and was readily
accessible by means of a stair-like formation, The shelf was two yards
wide and its gentle inclination, its remarkable evenness and
regularity conveyed the idea of an ancient road hewn in the face of
the cliff. It was overhung by the wall, as if by the sharply sundered
half of a high arcade.</p>

<p><q>There's our road to Hades,</q> said Bellman. <q>And the
downgrade is easy enough at that.</q></p>

<p><q>What's the use of going further?</q> said Maspic. <q>I, for one,
have had enough darkness already. And if we were to find anything by
going on, it would be valueless&mdash;or unpleasant.</q></p>

<p>Bellman hesitated. <q>Maybe you're right. But I'd like to follow
that ledge far enough to get some idea of the magnitude of the
gulf. You and Chivers can wait here, if you're afraid.</q></p>

<p>Chivers and Maspic, apparently, were unwilling to avow whatever
trepidation they might have felt. They followed Bellman along the
shelf, hugging the inner wall. Bellman, however, strode carelessly on
the verge, often flashing his torch into the vastitude that engulfed
its feeble beam.</p>

<p>More and more, through its uniform breadth, inclination and
smoothness, and the demi-arch of cliff above, the shelf impressed the
earthmen as being an artificial road But who could have made and used
it? In what forgotten ages and for what enigmatic purpose had it been
designed? The imagination of the terrestrials failed before the
stupendous gulfs of Martian antiquity that yawned in such tenebrous
queries.</p>

<p>Bellman thought that the wall curved inward upon itself by slow
degrees. No doubt they would round the entire abyss in time by
following the road. Perhaps it wound in a slow, tremendous spiral,
ever downward, about and about, to the very bowels of Mars.</p>

<p>He and the others were awed into lengthening intervals of
silence. They were horribly startled, when, as they went on, they
heard in the depths beneath the same peculiar long-drawn sound or
combination of sounds which they had heard in the outer cavern. It
suggested other images now: the rustling was a file-like scraping; the
soft, methodical, myriad smacking was vaguely similar to the noise
made by some enormous creature that withdraws its feet from a
quagmire.</p>

<p>The sound was inexplicable, terrifying. Part of its terror lay in
an implication of <em>remoteness</em>, which appeared to signalize the
enormity of its cause, and to emphasize the profundity of the
abysm. Heard in that planetary pit beneath a lifeless desert it
astonished&mdash;and shocked. Even Bellman, intrepid heretofore, began
to succumb to the formless horror that rose up like an emanation from
the night.</p>

<p>The noise grew fainter and ceased at length, giving somehow the
idea that its maker had gone directly down on the perpendicular wall
into nether reaches of the gulf.</p>

<p><q>Shall we go back?</q> inquired Chivers.</p>

<p><q>We might as well ,</q> assented Bellman without demur. <q>It
would take all eternity to explore this place anyway.</q></p>

<p>They started to retrace their way along the ledge. All three, with
that extra-tactile sense which warns of the approach of hidden danger,
were now troubled and alert. Though the gulf had grown silent once
more with that withdrawal of the strange noise, they somehow felt that
they were not alone. Whence the peril would come, or in what shape,
they could not surmise; but they felt an alarm that was almost
panic. Tacitly, none of them mentioned it; nor did they discuss the
eerie mystery on which they had stumbled in a manner so
fortuitous.</p>

<p>Maspic was a little ahead of the others now. They had covered at
least half of the distance to the old cavern-channel, when his torch,
playing for twenty feet ahead on the path, illumined an array of
whitish figures, three abreast, that blocked the way. The flashlights
of Bellman and Chivers, coming close behind, brought out with hideous
clearness the vanward limbs and faces of the throng, but could not
determine its number.</p>

<p>The creatures, who stood perfectly motionless and silent, as if
awaiting the earthmen, were generically similar to the Aihais or
Martian natives. They seemed however, to represent an extremely
degraded and aberrant type, and the fungus-like pallor of their bodies
denoted many ages of underground life. They were smaller too, than
full-grown Aihais, being, on the average, about five feet tall. They
possessed the enormous open nostrils. the flaring ears, the barrel
chests and lanky limbs of the Martians&mdash;but all of them were
eyeless. In the faces of some, there were faint, rudimentary slits
where the eyes should have been; in the faces of others, there were
deep and empty orbits that suggested a removal of the eyeballs.</p>

<p><q>Lord! what a ghastly crew!</q> cried Maspic. <q>Where do they
come from? and what do they want?</q></p>

<p><q>Can't imagine,</q> said Bellman. <q>But our situation is
somewhat ticklish&mdash;unless they are friendly. They must have been
hiding on the shelves in the cavern above when we entered.</q></p>

<p>Stepping boldly forward, ahead of Maspic, he addressed the
creatures in the guttural Aihai tongue, many of whose vocables are
scarcely to be articulated by an earthman. Some of the people stirred
uneasily, and emitted shrill, cheeping sounds that bore little
likeness to the Martian language. It was plain that they could not
understand Bellman. Sign-language, by reason of their blindness, would
have been equally useless.</p>

<p>Bellman drew his revolver, enjoining the others to follow
suit. <q>We've got to get through them somehow,</q> he said <q>And if
they won't let us pass without interference&mdash;</q> the click of a
cocked hammer served to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>As if the metallic sound had been an awaited signal the press of
blind white beings sprang into sudden motion and surged forward upon
the terrestrials. It was like the onset of automatons&mdash;an
irresistible striding of machines, concerted and methodical, beneath
the direction of a hidden power.</p>

<p>Bellman pulled his trigger, once, twice, thrice, at a point-blank
range. It was impossible to miss; but the bullets were futile as
pebbles flung at the spate of an onrushing torrent. The eyeless beings
did not waver, though two of them began to bleed the yellowish-red
fluid that serves the Martians for blood. The foremost of them,
unwounded, and moving with diabolical sureness, caught Bellman's arm
with long, four-jointed fingers, and jerked the revolver from his
grasp before he could press the trigger again. Curiously enough. the
creature did not try to deprive him of his torch, which he now carried
in his left hand; and he saw the steely flash of the Colt, as it
hurtled down into darkness and space from the hand of the
Martian. Then the fungus-white bodies, milling horribly on the narrow
road, were all about him, pressing so closely that there was no room
for effectual resistance.</p>

<p>Chivers and Maspic, after firing a few shots, were also deprived of
their weapons, but, through an uncanny discrimination, were permitted
to retain their flashlights.</p>

<p>The entire episode had been a matter of moments. There was only a
brief slackening of the onward motion of the throng, two of whose
members had been shot down by Chivers and Maspic and then hurled
expeditiously into the gulf by their fellows. The foremost ranks,
opening deftly, included the earthmen and forced them to turn
backward. Then, tightly caught in a moving vice of bodies, they were
borne resistlessly along. Handicapped by the fear of dropping their
torches, they could do nothing against the nightmare torrent. Rushing
with dreadful strides on a path that led ever deeper into the abyss,
and able to see only the lit backs and members of the creatures before
them, they became a part of that eyeless and cryptic army.</p>

<p>Behind them, there seemed to be scores of the Martians, driving
them on implacably. After awhile, their plight began to paralyze their
faculties. It seemed that they moved no longer with human steps, but
with the swift and automatic stalking of the clammy things that
pressed about them. Thought, volition, even terror, were numbed by the
unearthly rhythm of those abyssward-beating feet. Constrained by this,
and by a sense of utter unreality, they spoke only at long intervals,
and then in monosyllables that appeared to have lost all proper
meaning, like the speech of machines. The blind people were wholly
silent&mdash;there was no sound, except that of a myriad, eternal
padding on the stone.</p>

<p>On, on they went, through ebon hours that belonged to no diurnal
period. Slowly, tortuously, the road curved inward, as if it were
coiled about the interior of a blind and cosmic Babel. The earthmen
felt that they must have circled the abyss many times in that terrific
spiral; but the distance they had gone, and the actual extent of the
stupefying gulf, were inconceivable.</p>

<p>Except for their torches, the night was absolute, unchangeable. It
was older than the sun, it had brooded there through all past
aeons. It accumulated above them like a monstrous burden; it yawned
frightfully beneath. From it, the strengthening stench of stagnant
waters rose. But still there was no sound other than the soft and
measured thud of marching feet that descended into a bottomless
Abaddon.</p>

<p>Somewhere, as if after the lapse of nocturnal ages, the pitward
rushing had ceased. Bellman, Chivers and Maspic felt the pressure of
crowded bodies relax; felt that they were standing still, while their
brains continued to beat the unhuman measure of that terrible
descent</p>

<p>Reason&mdash;and horror&mdash;returned to them slowly. Bellman
lifted his flashlight, and the circling ray recovered the throng of
Martians, many of whom were dispersing in a huge cavern where the
gulf-circling road had now ended. Others of the beings remained,
however, as if to keep guard over the earthmen. They quivered alertly
at Bellman's movements as if aware of them through an unknown
sense.</p>

<p>Close at hand, on the right, the level floor ended abruptly, and
stepping to the verge, Bellman saw that the cavern was an open chamber
in the perpendicular wall. Far, far below in the blackness, a
phosphorescent glimmer played to and fro, like noctilucae on an
underworld ocean. A slow, fetid wind blew upon him; and he heard the
weird sighing of waters about the sunken cliffs: waters that had ebbed
through untold cycles, during the planet's dessication.</p>

<p>He turned giddily away. His companions were examining the cave's
interior. It seemed that the place was of artificial origin; for,
darting here and there, the torch-beams brought out enormous
columnations lined with deeply graven bas-reliefs. Who had carved them
or when, were problems no less insoluble than the origin of the
cliff-hewn road. Their details were obscene as the visions of madness,
they shocked the eye like a violent blow, conveying an extra-human
evil, a bottomless malignity, in the passing moment of disclosure.</p>

<p>The cave was indeed of stupendous extent, running far back in the
cliff, and with numerous exits, giving, no doubt, on further
ramifications. The beams of the flashlights half dislodged the
flapping shadows of shelved recesses; caught the salients of far walls
that climbed and beetled into inaccessible gloom; played on the
creatures that went to and fro like monstrous living fungi; gave to a
brief visual existence the pale and polyp-like plants that clung
noisomely to the nighted stone.</p>

<p>The place was overpowering, it oppressed the senses, crushed the
brain. The very stone was like an embodiment of darkness; and light
and vision were ephemeral intruders in this demesne of the
blind. Somehow, the earthmen were weighed down by a conviction that
escape was impossible. A strange lethargy claimed them. They did not
even discuss their situation, but stood listless and silent.</p>

<p>Anon, from the filthy gloom, a number of the Martians
reappeared. With the same suggestion of controlled automatism that had
marked all their actions, they gathered about the men once more, and
urged them into the yawning cavern.</p>

<p>Step by step, the three were borne along in that weird and leprous
procession. The obscene columns multiplied, the cave deepened before
them with endless vistas, like a revelation of foul things that drowse
at the nadir of night. Faintly at first, but more strongly as they
went on, there came to them an insidious feeling of somnolence, such
as might have been caused by mephitical effluvia. They rebelled
against it, for the drowsiness was somehow dark and evil. It grew
heavier upon them&mdash;and then they came to the core of the
horror.</p>

<p>Between the thick and seemingly topless pillars, the floor ascended
in an altar of seven oblique and pyramidal tiers. On the top, there
squatted an image of pale metal: a thing no larger than a hare, but
monstrous beyond all imagining.</p>

<p>The Martians crowded about the earthmen. One of them took Bellman
by the arm, as if urging him to climb the altar. With the slow steps
of a dreamer, he mounted the sloping tiers, and Chivers and Maspic
followed.</p>

<p>The image resembled nothing they had ever seen on the red
planet&mdash;or elsewhere. It was carven of whitish gold, and it
represented a humped animal with a smooth and overhanging carapace
from beneath which its head and members issued in tortoise
fashion. The head was venomously flat, triangular&mdash;and
eyeless. From the drooping corners of the cruelly slitted mouth, two
long proboscides curved upward, hollow and cuplike at the ends. The
thing was furnished with a series of short legs, issuing at uniform
intervals from under the carapace, and a curious double tail was
coiled and braided beneath its crouching body. The feet were round,
and had the shape of small, inverted goblets.</p>

<p>Unclean and bestial as a figment of some atavistic madness, the
eidolon seemed to drowse on the altar. It troubled the mind with a
slow, insidious horror, it assailed the senses with an emanating
stupor, an effluence as of primal worlds before the creation of light,
where life might teem and raven slothfully in the blind ooze.</p>

<p>Dimly the earthmen saw that the altar swarmed with the blind
Martians, who were crowding past them about the image. As if in some
fantastic ritual of touch, these creatures were fondling the eidolon
with their lank fingers, were tracing its loathsome outlines. Upon
their brutal faces a narcotic ecstasy was imprinted. Compelled like
sleepers in some abhorrent dream, Bellman, Chivers and Maspic followed
their example.</p>

<p>The thing was cold to the touch, and clammy as if it had lain
recently in a bed of slime. But it seemed to live, to throb and swell
under their finger-tips. From it, in heavy, ceaseless waves, a dark
vibration surged: an opiate power that clouded the eyes; that poured
its baleful slumber into the blood.</p>

<p>With senses that swam in a strange darkness, they were vaguely
aware of the pressure of thronging bodies that displaced them at the
altar-summit. Anon, certain of these, recoiling as if satiate with the
drug-like effluence, bore them along the oblique tiers to the
cavern-floor. Still retaining their torches in nerveless fingers, they
saw that the place teemed with the white people, who had gathered for
that unholy ceremony. Through blackening blurs of shadow, the men
watched them as they seethed up and down on the pyramid like a
leprous, living frieze.</p>

<p>Chivers and Maspic, yielding first to the influence, slid to the
floor in utter sopor. But Bellman, more resistant, seemed to fall and
drift through a world of lightless dreams. His sensations were
anomalous, unfamiliar to the last degree. Everywhere there was a
brooding, <em>palpable</em> Power for which he could find no visual
image: a Power that exhaled a miasmal slumber. In those dreams, by
insensible graduations, forgetting the last glimmer of his human self,
he somehow identified himself with the eyeless people; he lived and
moved as they, in profound caverns, on nighted roads. And yet he was
something else: an Entity without name that ruled over the blind and
was worshipped by them; a thing that dwelt in the ancient putrescent
waters, in the nether deep, and came forth at intervals to raven
unspeakably. In that duality of being, he sated himself at blind
feasts&mdash;and was also devoured. With all this, like a third
element of identity, the eidolon was associated: but only a tactile
sense, and not as an optic memory. There was no light
anywhere&mdash;and not even the recollection of light.</p>

<p>Whether he passed from these obscure nightmares into dreamless
slumber, he could not know. His awakening, dark and lethargic, was
like a continuation of the dreams at first. Then, opening his sodden
lids, he saw the shaft of fight that lay on the floor front his fallen
torch. The light poured against something that he could not recognize
in his drugged awareness. Yet it troubled him, and a dawning horror
touched his faculties into life.</p>

<p>By degrees, it came to him that the thing he saw was the half-eaten
body of one of the eyeless troglodytes. Some of the members were
missing; and the remainder was gnawed even to the curiously
articulated bones.</p>

<p>Bellman rose unsteadily and looked about with eyes that still held
a web-like blurring of shadow. Chivers and Maspic lay beside him in
heavy stupor; and along the cavern and upon the seven-tiered altar
were sprawled the devotees of the somnific image.</p>

<p>His other senses began to awake from their lethargy, and he thought
that he heard a noise that was somehow familiar: a sharp slithering,
together with a measured sucking. The sound withdrew among the massy
pillars, beyond the sleeping bodies. A smell as of rotten water tinged
the air, and he saw that there were many curious rings of wetness on
the stone, such as might be made by the rims of inverted
cups. Preserving the order of footprints, they led away from the
half-devoured Martian, into the shadows of that outer cave which
verged upon the abyss; the direction in which the queer noise had
passed, sinking now to inaudibility.</p>

<p>In Bellman's mind a mad terror rose and struggled with the spell
that still benumbed him. He stooped down above Maspic and Chivers, and
shook them roughly in turn, till they opened their eyes and began to
protest with drowsy murmurs.</p>

<p><q>Get up, damn you,</q> he admonished them. <q>If we're ever to
escape from this hell-hole, now's the time.</q></p>

<p>By dint of many oaths and objurgations and much muscular effort, he
succeeded in getting his companions to their feet. Lurching drunkenly,
they followed Bellman among the sprawled Martians, away from the
pyramid on which the eidolon of white gold still brooded in malign
somnolence above its worshippers.</p>

<p>A clouding heaviness hung upon Bellman; but somehow there was a
relaxation of the opiate spell. He felt a revival of volition and a
great desire to escape from the gulf and from all that dwelt in its
darkness. The others, more deeply enslaved by the drowsy power,
accepted his leadership and guidance in a numb, brute-like
fashion.</p>

<p>He felt sure that he could retrace the route by which they had
approached the altar. This, it seemed, was also the course that had
been taken by the maker of the ring-like marks of fetid
wetness. Wandering on amid the repugnantly carven columns for what
seemed an enormous distance, they came at last to the sheer verge,
that portice of the black Tartarus, from which they could look down on
its ultimate gulf. Far beneath, on those putrefying waters, the
phosphorescence ran in widening circles, as if troubled by the plunge
of a heavy body. To the very edge, at their feet, the watery rings
were imprinted on the rock.</p>

<p>They turned away, Bellman, shuddering with half-memories of his
blind dreams, and the terror of his awakening, found at the cave's
corner the beginning of that upward road which skirted the abyss: the
road that would take them back to the lost sun.</p>

<p>At his injunction, Maspic and Chivers turned off their flashlights
to conserve the batteries. It was doubtful how much longer these would
last and light was their prime necessity. His own torch would serve
for the three till it became exhausted.</p>

<p>There was no sound or stirring of life from that cave of lightless
sleep where the Martians lay about the narcotizing image. But a fear
such as he had never felt in all his adventurings caused Bellman to
sicken and turn faint as he listened at its threshold.</p>

<p>The gulf, too, was silent; and the circles of phosphor had ceased
to widen on the waters. Yet somehow the silence was a thing that
clogged the senses, retarded the limbs. It rose up around Bellman like
the clutching slime of some nethermost pit, in which he must
drown. With dragging effort he began the ascent, hauling, cursing and
kicking his companions till they responded like drowsy animals.</p>

<p>It was a climb through Limbo, an ascent from nadir through darkness
that seemed palpable and viscid. On and up they toiled, along the
monotonous, imperceptibly winding grade where all measure of distance
was lost, and time was meted only by the repetition of eternal
steps. The night lowered before Bellman's feeble shaft of light; it
closed behind like an all-engulfing sea, relentless and patient;
biding its time till the torch should go out.</p>

<p>Looking over the verge at intervals, Bellman saw the gradual fading
of the phosphorescence in the depths. Fantastic images rose in his
mind, it was like the last glimmering of hell-fire in some extinct
inferno; like the drowning of nebulae in voids beneath the
universe. He felt the giddiness of one who looks down upon infinite
space... Anon there was only blackness; and he knew by this token the
awful distance they had climbed.</p>

<p>The minor urges of hunger, thirst, fatigue, had been trod under by
the fear that impelled him. From Maspic and Chivers, very slowly, the
clogging stupor lifted, and they too were conscious of an adumbration
of terror vast as the night itself. The blows and kicks and
objurgations of Bellman were no longer needed to drive them on.</p>

<p>Evil, ancient, soporous, the night hung about them. It was like the
thick and fetid fur of bats: a material thing that choked the lungs,
that deadened all the senses. It was silent as the slumber of dead
worlds... But out of that silence, after the lapse of apparent years,
a twofold and familiar sound arose and overtook the fugitives: the
sound of something that slithered over stone far down in the abyss:
the sucking noise of a creature that withdrew its feet as if from a
quagmire. Inexplicable, and arousing mad, incongruous ideas, like a
sound heard in delirium, it quickened the earthmen's terror into
sudden frenzy,</p>

<p><q>God! what is it?</q> breathed Bellman. He seemed to remember
sightless things, abhorrent, <em>palpable</em> shapes of primal night,
that were no legitimate part of human recollection. His dreams and his
nightmare awakening in the cave&mdash;the white eidolon&mdash;the
half-eaten troglodyte of the nether cliffs&mdash;the rings of wetness,
leading toward the gulf&mdash;all returned like the figments of a
teeming madness, all to assail him on that terrible road midway
between the underworld sea and the surface of Mars.</p>

<p>His question was answered only by a continuation of the noise. It
seemed to grow louder&mdash;to ascend the wall beneath. Maspic and
Chivers, snapping on their lights, began to run with frantic leaps;
and Bellman, losing his last remnant of control, followed suit.</p>

<p>It was a race with unknown horror. Above the labored beating of
their hearts, the measured thudding of their feet, the men still heard
that sinister, unaccountable sound. They seemed to race on through
leagues of blackness; and yet the noise drew nearer, climbing below
them, as if its maker were a thing that walked on the sheer cliff.</p>

<p>Now the sound was appallingly close&mdash;and a little ahead. It
ceased abruptly. The running lights of Maspic and Chivers, who moved
abreast, discovered the crouching thing that filled the two-yard shelf
from side to side.</p>

<p>Hardened adventurers though they were the men would have shrieked
aloud with hysteria, or would have hurled themselves from the
precipice, if the sight had not induced a kind of catalepsy. It was as
if the pale idol of the pyramid, swollen to mammoth proportions, and
loathsomely alive, had come up from the abyss and was squatting before
them!</p>

<p>Here, plainly, was the creature that had served as a model for that
atrocious image. The humped, enormous carapace, vaguely recalling the
armor of the glyptodon, shone with a luster as of wet white gold. The
eyeless head, alert but sonmolent, was thrust forward on a neck that
arched obscenely. A dozen or more of short legs, with goblet-shapen
feet, protruded slantwise beneath the overhanging shell. The two
proboscides, yard-long, with cupped ends, arose from the corners of
the cruelly slitted mouth and waved slowly in air toward the
earthmen.</p>

<p>The thing, it seemed, was old as that dying planet, an unknown form
of primal life that had dwelt always in the caverned waters. Before
it, the faculties of the earthmen were drugged by an evil stupor, such
as they had felt before the eidolon. They stood with their flashlights
playing full on the Terror; and they could not move nor cry out when
it reared suddenly erect, revealing its ridged belly and the queer
double tail that slithered and rustled metallically on the rock. Its
numerous feet, beheld in this posture, were hollow and chalice-like,
and they oozed with mephitic wetness. No doubt they served for
suction-pads, enabling it to walk on a perpendicular surface.</p>

<p>Inconceivably swift and sure in all its motions, with short strides
on its hindmost legs, levered by the tail, the monster came forward on
the helpless men. Unerringly the two proboscides curved over, and
their ends came down on Chivers' eyes as he stood with lifted
face. They rested there, covering the entire sockets&mdash;for a
moment only. Then there was an agonizing scream, as the hollow tips
were withdrawn with a sweeping movement lithe and vigorous as the
lashing of serpents.</p>

<p>Chivers swayed slowly, nodding his head, and twisting about in
half-narcotised pain. Maspic, standing at his side, saw in a dull and
dream-like manner the gaping orbits from which the eyes were gone. It
was the last thing that he ever saw. At that instant the monster
turned from Chivers, and the terrible cups dripping with blood and
fetor, descended on Maspic's own eyes.</p>

<p>Bellman, who had paused close behind the others, comprehended what
was occurring like one who witnesses the abominations of a nightmare
but is powerless to intervene or flee. He saw the movements of the
cupped members, he heard the single atrocious cry that was wrung from
Chivers, and the swiftly ensuing scream of Maspic. Then, above the
heads of his fellows, who still held their useless torches in rigid
fingers, the proboscides came toward him&hellip;</p>

<p>With blood rilling heavily upon their faces, with the somnolent,
vigilant, implacable and eyeless Shape at their heels, herding them
on, restraining them when they tottered at the brink, the three began
their second descent of the road that went down forever to a
night-bound Avernus.</p>
