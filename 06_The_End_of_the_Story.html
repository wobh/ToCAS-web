<p>The following narrative was found among the papers of Christophe
Morand, a young law-student of Tours, after his unaccountable
disappearance during a visit at his father's home near Moulins, in
November, 1798:</p>
</aside>

<p>A sinister brownish-purple autumn twilight, made premature by the
imminence of a sudden thunderstorm, had filled the forest of
Averoigne. The trees along my road were already blurred to ebon
masses, and the road itself, pale and spectral before me in the
thickening gloom, seemed to waver and quiver slightly, as with the
tremor of some mysterious earthquake. I spurred my horse, who was
woefully tired with a journey begun at dawn, and had fallen hours ago
to a protesting and reluctant trot, and we galloped adown the
darkening road between enormous oaks that seemed to lean toward us
with boughs like clutching fingers as we passed.</p>

<p>With dreadful rapidity, the night was upon us, the blackness became
a tangible clinging veil; a nightrnare confusion and desperation drove
me to spur my mount again with a more cruel rigor; and now, as we
went, the first far-off mutter of the storm mingled with the clatter
of my horse's hoofs, and the first lightning flashes illumed our way,
which, to my amazement (since I believed myself on the main highway
through Averoigne), had inexplicably narrowed to a well-trodden
footpath. Feeling sure that I had gone astray, but not caring to
retrace my steps in the teeth of darkness and the towering clouds of
the tempest, I hurried on, hoping, as seemed reasonable, that a path
so plainly worn would lead eventually to some house or chateau. where
I could find refuge for the night. My hope was wellfounded, for within
a few minutes I descried a glimmering light through the forest-boughs,
and came suddenly to an open glade, where, on a gentle eminence, a
large building loomed, with several litten windows in the lower story,
and a top that was well-nigh indistinguishable against the bulks of
driven cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless a monastery,&rdquo; I thought, as I drew rein, and
descending from my exhausted mount, lifted the heavy brazen knocker in
the form of a dog's head and let it fall on the oaken door. The sound
was unexpectedly loud and sonorous, with a reverberation almost
sepulchral, and I shivered involuntarily, with a sense of startlement,
of unwonted dismay. This, a moment later, was wholly dissipated when
the door was thrown open and a tall, ruddyfeatured monk stood before
me in the cheerful glow of the cressets that illumed a capacious
hallway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bid you welcome to the abbey of Perigon,&rdquo; he said, in a
suave rumble, and even as he spoke, another robed and hooded figure
appeared and took my horse in charge. As I murmured my thanks and
acknowledgments, the storm broke and tremendous gusts of rain,
accompanied by evernearing peals of thunder, drove with demoniac fury
on the door that had closed behind me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is fortunate that you found us when you did,&rdquo; observed my
host. &ldquo;Twere ill for man and beast to be abroad in such a
hell-brew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Divining without question that I was hungry as well as tired, he
led me to the refectory and set before me a bountiful meal of mutton,
brown bread, lentils and a strong excellent red wine.</p>

<p>He sat opposite me at the refectory table while I ate, and, with my
hunger a little mollifed, I took occasion to scan him more
attentively. He was both tall and stoutly built, and his features,
where the brow was no less broad than the powerful jaw, betokened
intellect as well as a love for good living. A certain delicacy and
refinement, an air of scholarship, of good taste and good breeding,
emanated from him, and I thought to myself: &ldquo;This monk is probably a
connoisseur of books as well as of wines.&rdquo; Doubtless my expression
betrayed the quickening of my curiosity, for he said, as if in
answer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Hilaire, the abbot of Perigon. We are a Benedictine order,
who live in amity with God and with all men, and we do not hold that
the spirit is to be enriched by the mortification or impoverishment of
the body. We have in our butteries an abundance of wholesome fare, in
our cellars the best and oldest vintages of the district of
Averoigne. And, if such thiags interest you, as mayhap they do, we
have a library that is stocked with rare tomes, with precious
manuscripts, with the finest works of heathendom and Christendom, even
to certain unique writings that survived the holocaust of
Alexandria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your hospitality,&rdquo; I said, bowing. &ldquo;I am
Christophe Morand, a law-student, on my way home from Tours to my
father's estate near Moulins. I, too, am a lover of books, and nothing
would delight me more than the privilege of inspecting a library so
rich and curious as the one whereof you speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forthwith, while I finished my meal, we fell to discussing the
classics, and to quoting and capping passages from Latin, Greek or
Christian authors. My host, I soon discovered, was a scholar of
uncommon attainments, with an erudition, a ready familiarity with both
ancient and modern literature that made my own seem as that of the
merest beginner by comparison. He, on his part, was so good as to
commend my far from perfect Latin, and by the time I had emptied my
bottle of red wine we were chatting familiarly like old friends.</p>

<p>All my fatigue had now flown, to be succeeded by a rare sense of
well-being, of physical comfort combined with mental alertness and
keenness. So, when the abbot suggested that we pay a visit to the
library, I assented with alacrity.</p>

<p>He led me down a long corridor, on each side of which were cells
belonging to the brothers of the order, and unlocked, with a huge
brazen key that depended from his girdle, the door of a great room
with lofty ceiling and several deep-set windows. Truly, he had not
exaggerated the resources of the library; for the long shelves were
overcrowded with books, and many volumes were piled high on the tables
or stacked in corners. There were rolls of papyrus, of parchment, of
vellum; there were strange Byzantine or Coptic bibles; there were old
Arabic and Persian manuscripts with floriated or jewel-studded covers;
there were scores of incunabula from the first printing-presses; there
were innumerable monkish copies of antique authors, bound in wood or
ivory, with rich illuminations and lettering that was often in itself
a work of art.</p>

<p>With a care that was both loving and meticulous, the abbot Hilaire
brought out volume after volume for my inspection. Many of them I had
never seen before; some were unknown to me even by fame or rumor. My
excited interest, my unfeigned enthusiasm, evidently pleased him, for
at length he pressed a hidden spring in one of the library tables and
drew out a long drawer, in which, he told me, were certain treasures
that he did not care to bring forth for the edification or delectation
of many, and whose very existence was undreamed of by the monks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;are three odes by Catullus which you
will not find in any published edition of his works. Here, also, is an
original manuscript of Sappho &mdash; a complete copy of a poem
otherwise extant only in brief fragments; here are two of the lost
tales of Miletus, a letter of Perides to Aspasia, an unknown dialogue
of Plato and an old Arabian work on astronomy, by some anonymous
author, in which the theories of Copernicus are anticipated. And,
lastly, here is the somewhat infamous Histoire d'Amour, by Bernard de
Vaillantcoeur, which was destroyed immediately upon publication, and
of which only one other copy is known to exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I gazed with mingled awe and curiosity on the unique, unheard-of
treasures he displayed, I saw in one corner of the drawer what
appeared to be a thin volume with plain untitled binding of dark
leather. I ventured to pick it up, and found that it contained a few
sheets of ciosely written manuscript in old French.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this?&rdquo; I queried, turning to look at Hilaire, whose face,
to my amazement, had suddenly assumed a melancholy and troubled
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It were better not to ask, my son.&rdquo; He crossed himself as he
spoke, and his voice was no longer mellow, but harsh, agitated, full
of a sorrowful perturbation. &ldquo;There is a curse on the pages that you
hold in your hand: an evil spell, a malign power is attached to them,
and he who would venture to peruse them is henceforward in dire peril
both of body and soul.&rdquo; He took the little volume from me as he
spoke, and returned it to the drawer, again crossing himself carefully
as he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; I dared to expostulate, &ldquo;how can such things
be? How can there be danger in a few written sheets of
parchment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christophe, there are things beyond your understanding, things
that it were not well for you to know. The might of Satan is
manifestable in devious modes, in diverse manners; there are other
temptations than those of the world and the flesh, there are evils no
less subtle than irresistible, there are hidden heresies, and
necromancies other than those which sorcerers practise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With what, then, are these pages concerned, that such occult
peril, such unholy power lurks within them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forbid you to ask.&rdquo; His tone was one of great rigor, with a
finality that dissuaded me from further questioning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you, my son,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the danger would be doubly
great, because you are young, ardent, full of desires and
curiosities. Believe me, it is better to forget that you have ever
seen this manuscript.&rdquo; He closed the hidden drawer, and as he did
so, the melancholy troubled look was replaced by his former
benignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, as he turned to one of the book-shelves, &ldquo;I
will show you the copy of Ovid that was owned by the poet
Petrarch.&rdquo; He was again the mellow scholar, the kindly, jovial
host, and it was evident that the mysterious manuscript was not to be
referred to again. But his odd perturbation, the dark and awful hints
he had let fall, the vague terrific terms of his proscription, had all
served to awaken my wildest curiosity, and, though I felt the
obsession to be unreasonable, I was quite unable to think of anything
else for the rest of the evening. All manner of speculations,
fantastic, absurd, outrageous, ludicrous, terrible, defiled through my
brain as I duly admired the incunabula which Hilaire took down so
tenderly from the shelves for my delectation.</p>

<p>At last, toward midnight, he led me to my room &mdash; a room
especially reserved for visitors, and with more of comfort, of actual
luxury in its hangings, carpets and deeply quilted bed than was
allowable in the cells of the monks or of the abbot himself. Even when
Hilaire had withdrawn, and I had proved for my satisfaction the
softness of the bed allotted me, my brain still whirled with questions
concerning the forbidden manuscript. Though the storm had now ceased,
it was long before I fell asleep; but slumber, when it finally came,
was dreamless and profound.</p>

<p>When I awoke, a river of sunshine clear as molten gold was pouring
through my wmdow. The storm had wholly vanished, and no lightest
tatter of cloud was visible anywhere in the pale-blue October
heavens. I ran to the window and peered out on a world of autumnal
forest and fields all a-sparkle with the diamonds of rain. All was
beautiful, all was idyllic to a degree that could be fully appreciated
only by one who had lived for a long time, as I had, within the walls
of a city, with towered buildings in lieu of trees and cobbled
pavements where grass should be. But, charming as it was, the
foreground held my gaze only for a few moments; then, beyond the tops
of the trees, I saw a hill, not more than a mile distant, on whose
summit there stood the ruins of some old chateau, the crumbling,
brokendown condition of whose walls and towers was plainly visible. It
drew my gaze irresistibly, with an overpowering sense of romantic
attraction, which somehow seemed so natural, so inevitable, that I did
not pause to analyze or wonder; and once having seen it, I could not
take my eyes away, but lingering at the window for how long I knew
not, scrutinizing as closely as I could the details of each timeshaken
turret and bastion. Some undefinable fascination was inherent in the
very form, the extent, the disposition of the pile &mdash; some
fascination not dissimilar to that exerted by a strain of music, by a
magical combination of words in poetry, by the features of a beloved
face. Gazing, I lost myself in reveries that I could not recall
afterward, but which left behind them the same tantalizing sense of
innominable delight which forgotten nocturnal dreams may sometimes
leave.</p>

<p>I was recalled to the actualities of life by a gentle knock at my
door, and realized that I had forgotten to dress myself. It was the
abbot, who came to inquire how I had passed the night, and to tell me
that breakfast was ready whenever I should care to arise. For some
reason, I felt a little embarrassed, even shamefaced, to have been
caught day-dreaming; and though this was doubtless unnecessary, I
apologized for my dilatoriness. Hilaire, I thought, gave me a keen,
inquiring look, which was quickly withdrawn, as, with the suave
courtesy of a good host, he assured me that there was nothing whatever
for which I need apologize.</p>

<p>When I had breakfast, I told Hilaire, with many expressions of
gratitude for his hospitality, that it was time for me to resume my
journey. But his regret at the announcement of my departure was so
unfeigned, his invitation to tarry for at least another night was so
genuinely hearty, so sincerely urgent, that I consented to remain. In
truth, I required no great amount of solicitation, for, apart from the
real liking I had taken to Hilaire, the mystery of the forbidden
manuscript had entirely enslaved my imagination, and I was loth to
leave without having learned more concerning it. Also, for a youth
with scholastic leanings, the freedom of the abbot's library was a
rare privilege, a precious opportunity not to be passed over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to pursue certain studies while I
am here, with the aid of your incomparable collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, you are more than welcome to remain for any length of
time, and you can have access to my books whenever it suits your need
or inclination.&rdquo; So saying, Hilaire detached the key of the library
from his girdle and gave it to me. &ldquo;There are duties,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;which will call me away from the monastery for a few hours
today, and doubtless you will desire to study in my absence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later, he excused himself and departed. With inward
felicitations on the longed-for opportunity that had fallen so readily
into my hands, I hastened to the library, with no thought save to read
the proscribed manuscript. Giving scarcely a glance at the laden
shelves, I sought the table with the secret drawer, and fumbled for
the spring. After a little anxious delay, I pressed the proper spot
and drew forth the drawer. An impulsion that had become a veritable
obsession, a fever of curiosity that bordered upon actual madness,
drove me, and if the safety of my soul had really depended upon it, I
could not have denied the desire which forced me to take from the
drawer the thin volume with plain unlettered binding.</p>

<p>Seating myself in a chair near one of the windows, I began to
peruse the pages, which were only six in number. The writing was
peculiar, with letter-forms of a fantasticality I had never met
before, and the French was not only old but well-night barbarous in
its quaint singularity. Notwithstanding the difficulty I found in
deciphering them, a mad, unaccountable thrill ran through me at the
first words, and I read on with all the sensations of a man who had
been bewitched or who had drunken a philtre of bewildering
potency.</p>

<p>There was no title, no date, and the writing was a narrative which
began almost as abruptly as it ended. It concerned one Gerard, Comte
de Venteillon, who, on the eve of his marriage to the renowned and
beautiful demoiselle, Eleanor des Lys, had met in the forest near his
chateau a strange, half-human creature with hoofs and horns. Now
Gerard, as the narrative explained, was a knightly youth of
indisputably proven valor, as wdl as a true Christian; so, in the name
of our Savior, Jesus Christ, he bade the creature stand and give an
account of itself.</p>

<p>Laughing wildly in the twilight, the bizarre being capered before
him, and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a satyr, and your Christ is less to me than the weeds that
grow on your kitchen-middens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Appalled by such blasphemy, Gerard would have drawn his sword to
slay the creature, but again it cried, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, Gerard de Venteillon, and I will tell you a secret,
knowing which, you will forget the worship of Christ, and forget your
beautiful bride of tomorrow, and turn your back on the world and on
the very sun itself with no reluctance and no regret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, albeit half uawillingly, Gerard lent the satyr an ear and it
came closer and whispered to him. And that which it whispered is not
known; but before it vanished amid the blackening shadows of the
forest, the satyr spoke aloud once more, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The power of Christ has prevailed like a black frost on all the
woods, the fields, the rivers, the mountains, where abode in their
felicity the glad, immortal goddesses and nymphs of yore. But still,
in the cryptic caverns of earth, in places far underground, like the
hell your priests have fabled, there dwells the pagan loveliness,
there cry the pagan ecstasies.&rdquo; And with the last words, the
creature laughed again its wild unhuman laugh, and disappeared among
the darkening boles of the twilight trees.</p>

<p>From that moment, a change was upon Gerard de Venteillon. He
returned to his chateau with downcast mien, speaking no cheery or
kindly word to his retainers, as was his wont, but sitting or pacing
always in silence, and scarcely heeding the food that was set before
him. Nor did he go that evening to visit his betrothed, as he had
promised; but, toward midnight, when a waning moon had arisen red as
from a bath of blood, he went forth clandestinely by the postern door
of the chateau, and followed an old, halfobliterated trail through the
woods, found his way to the ruins of the Chateau des Faussesflammes,
which stands on a hill opposite the Benedictine abbey of Perigon.</p>

<p>Now these ruins (said the manuscript) are very old, and have long
been avoided by the people of the district; for a legendry of
immemorial evil clings about them, and it is said that they are the
dwelling-place of foul spirits, the rendezvous of sorcerers and
succubi. But Gerard, as if oblivious or fearless of their ill renown,
plunged like one who is devil-driven into the shadow of the crumbling
walls, and went, with the careful-groping of a man who follows some
given direction, to the northern end of the courtyard. There, directly
between and below the two centermost windows, which, it may be, looked
forth from the chamber of forgotten chatelaines, he pressed with his
right foot on a flagstone differing from those about it in being of a
triangular form. And the flagstone moved and tilted beneath his foot,
revealing a flight of granite steps that went down into the
earth. Then, lighting a taper he had brought with him, Gerard
descended the steps, and the flagstone swung into place behind
him.</p>

<p>On the morrow, his betrothed, Eleanor des Lys, and all her bridal
train, waited vainly for him at the cathedral of Vyones, the principal
town of Averoigne, where the wedding had been set. And from that time
his face was beheld by no man, and no vaguest rumor of Gerard de
Venteillon or of the fate that befell him has ever passed among the
living&hellip;</p>

<p>Such was the substance of the forbidden manuscript, and thus it
ended. As I have said before, there was no date, nor was there
anything to indicate by whom it had been written or how the knowledge
of the happenings related had come into the writer's possession. But,
oddly enough, it did not occur to me to doubt their veridity for a
moment; and the curiosity I had felt concerning the contents of the
manuscript was now replaced by a burning desire, a thousandfold more
powerful, more obsessive, to know the ending of the story and to learn
what Gerard de Venteillon had found when he descended the hidden
steps.</p>

<p>In reading the tale, it had of course occurred to me that the ruins
of the Chateau des Faussesflammes, described therein, were the very
same ruins I had seen that morning from my chamber window; and
pondering this, I became more and more possessed by an insane fever,
by a frenetic, unholy excitement. Returning the manuscript to the
secret drawer, I left the library and wandered for awhile in an
aimless fashion about the corridors of the monastery. Chancing to meet
there the same monk who had taken my horse in charge the previous
evening, I ventured to question him, as discreetly and casually as I
could, regarding the ruins which were visible from the abbey
windows.</p>

<p>He crossed himself, and a frightened look came over his broad,
placid face at my query.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ruins are those of the Chateau des Faussesflammes,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;For untold years, men say, they have been the haunt of
unholy spirits, of witches and demons; and festivals not to be
described or even named are held within their walls. No weapon known
to man, no exorcism or holy water, has ever prevailed against these
demons; many brave cavaliers and monks have disappeared amid the
shadows of Faussesflammes, never to return; and once, it is told, an
abbot of Perigon went thither to make war on the powers of evil; but
what befell him at the hands of the succubi is not known or
conjectured. Some say that the demons are abominable hags whose bodies
terminate in serpentine coils; others that they are women of more than
mortal beauty, whose kisses are a diabolic delight that consumes the
flesh of men with the fierceness of hell-fire&hellip; As for me, I
know not whether such tales are true; but I should not care to venture
within the walls of Faussesflammes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before he had finished speaking, a resolve had sprung to life
full-born in my mind: I felt that I must go to the Chateau des
Faussesflammes and learn for myself, if possible, all that could be
learned. The impulse was immediate, overwhehning, ineluctable; and
even if I had so desired, I could no more have fought against it than
if I had been the victim of some sorcerer's invultuation. The
proscription of the abbot Hilaire, the strange unfinished tale in the
old manuscript, the evil legendry at which the monk had now hinted
&mdash; all these, it would seem, should have served to frighten and
deter me from such a resolve; but, on the contrary, by some bizarre
inversion of thought, they seemed to conceal some delectable mystery,
to denote a hidden world of ineffable things, of vague undreamable
pleasures that set my brain on fire and made my pulses throb
deliriously. I did not know, I could not conceive, of what these
pleasures would consist; but in some mystical manner I was as sure of
their ultimate reality as the abbot Hilaire was sure of heaven.</p>

<p>I determined to go that very afternoon, in the absence of Hilaire,
who, I felt instinctively, might be suspicious of any such intention
on my part and would surely be inimical toward its fulfillment.</p>

<p>My preparations were very simple: I put in my pockets a small taper
from my room and the heel of a loaf of bread from the refectory; and
making sure that a little dagger which I always carried was in its
sheath, I left the monastery forthwith. Meeting two of the brothers in
the courtyard, I told them I was going for a short walk in the
neighboring woods. They gave me a jovial &ldquo;pax vobiscum&rdquo; and went
upon their way in the spirit of the words.</p>

<p>Heading directly as I could for Faussesflammes, whose turrets were
often lost behind the high and interlacing boughs, I entered the
forest. There were no paths, and often I was conpelled to brief
detours and divagations by the thickness of the underbrush. In my
feverous hurry to reach the ruins, it seemed hours before I came to
the top of the hill which Faussesflammes surmounted, but probably it
was little more than thirty minutes. Climbing the last declivity of
the boulder-strewn slope, I came suddenly within view of the chateau,
standing close at hand in the center of the level table which formed
the summit. Trees had taken root in its broken-down walls, and the
ruinous gateway that gave on the courtyard was half-choked by bushes,
brambles and nettle-plants. Forcing my way through, not without
difficulty, and with clothing that had suffered from the
bramblethorns, I went, like Gerard de Venteillon in the old
manuscript, to the northern end of the court. Enormous evil-looking
weeds were rooted between the flagstones, rearing their thick and
fleshy leaves that had turned to dull sinister maroons and purples
with the onset of autumn. But I soon found the triangular flagstone
indicated in the tale, and without the slightest delay or hesitation I
pressed upon it with my right foot.</p>

<p>A mad shiver, a thrill of adventurous triumph that was mingled with
something of trepidation, leaped through me when the great flagstone
tilted easily beneath my foot, disclosing dark steps of granite, even
as in the story. Now, for a moment, the vaguely hinted horrors of the
monkish legends became imminently real in my imagination, and I paused
before the black opening that was to engulf me, eondering if some
satanic spell had not drawn me thither to perils of unknown terror and
inconceivable gravity.</p>

<p>Only for a few instants, however, did I hesitate. Then the sense of
peril faded, the monkish horrors became a fantastic dream, and the
charm of things unformulable, but ever closer at hand, always more
readily attainable, tightened about me like the embrace of amorous
arms. I lit my taper, I descended the stair; and even as behind Gerard
de Venteillon, the triangular block of stone silently resumed its
place in the paving of the court above me. Doubtless it was moved by
some mechanism operable by a man's weight on one of the steps; but I
did not pause to consider its modus operandi, or to wonder if there
were any way by which it could be worked from beneath to permit my
return.</p>

<p>There were perhaps a dozen steps, terminating in a low, narrow,
musty vault that was void of anything more substantial than ancient,
dust-encumbered cobwebs. At the end, a small doorway admitted me to a
second vault that differed from the first only in being larger and
dustier. I passed through several such vaults, and then found myself
in a long passage or tunnel, half blocked in places by boulders or
heaps of rubble that had fallen from the crumbling sides. It was very
damp, and full of the noisome odor of stagnant waters and subterranean
mold. My feet splashed more than once in little pools, and drops fell
upon me from above, fetid and foul as if they had oozed from a
charnel.</p>

<p>Beyond the wavering circle of light that my taper maintained, it
seemed to me that the coils of dim and shadowy serpents slithered away
in the darkness at my approach; but I could not be sure whether they
really were serpents, or only the troubled and retreating shadows,
seen by an eye that was still unaccustomed to the gloom of the
vaults.</p>

<p>Rounding a sudden turn in the passage, I saw the last thing I had
dreamt of seeing &mdash; the gleam of sunlight at what was apparently
the tunnel's end. I scarcely know what I had expected to find, but
such an eventuation was somehow altogether unanticipated. I hurried
on, in some confusion of thought, and stumbled through the opening, to
find myself blinking in the full rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Even before I had sufficiently recovered my wits and my eyesight to
take note of the landscape before me, I was struck by a strange
circumstance: Though it had been early afternoon when I entered the
vaults, and though my passage through them could have been a matter of
no more than a few minutes, the sun was now nearing the horizon. There
was also a difference in its light, which was both brighter and
mellower than the sun I had seen above Averoigne; and the sky itself
was intensely blue, with no hint of autumnal pallor.</p>

<p>Now, with ever-increasing stupefaction, I stared about me, and
could find nothing familiar or even credible in the scene upon which I
had emerged. Contrary to all reasonable expectation, there was no
semblance of the hill upon which Faussesflammes stood, or of the
adjoining country; but around me was a placid land of rolling meadows,
through which a golden-gleaming river meandered toward a sea of
deepest azure that was visible beyond the tops of laureltrees&hellip;
But there are no laurel-trees in Averoigne, and the sea is hundreds of
miles away: judge, then, my complete confusion and dumbfoundment.</p>

<p>It was a scene of such loveliness as I have never before
beheld. The meadow-grass at my feet was softer and more lustrous than
emerald velvet, and was full of violets and many-colored
asphodels. The dark green of ilex-trees was mirrored in the golden
river, and far away I saw the pale gleam of a marble acropolis on a
low summit above the plain. All things bore the aspect of a mild and
clement spring that was verging upon an opulent summer. I felt as if I
had stepped into a land of classic myth, of Grecian legend; and moment
by moment, all surprise, all wonder as to how I could have come there,
was drowned in a sense of ever-growing ecstasy before the utter,
ineffable beauty of the landscape.</p>

<p>Near by, in a laurel-grove, a white roof shone in the late rays of
the sun. I was drawn toward it by the same allurement, only far more
potent and urgent, which I had felt on seeing the forbidden manuscript
and the ruins of Faussesflammes. Here, I knew with an esoteric
certainty, was the culmination of my quest, the reward of all my mad
and perhaps impious curiosity.</p>

<p>As I entered the grove, I heard laughter among the trees, blending
harmoniously with the low murmur of their leaves in a soft, balmy
wind. I thought I saw vague forms that melted among the boles at my
approach; and once a shaggy, goat-like creature with human head and
body ran across my path, as if in pursuit of a flying nymph.</p>

<p>In the heart of the grove, I found a marble place with a portico of
Doric columns. As I neared it, I was greeted by two women in the
costume of ancient slaves; and though my Greek is of the meagerest, I
found no difficulty in comprehending their speech, which was of Attic
purity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our mistress, Nycea, awaits you,&rdquo; they told me. I could no
longer marvel at anything, but accepted my situation without question
or surmise, like one who resigns himself to the progress of some
delightful dream. Probably, I thought, it was a dream, and I was still
lying in my bed at the monastery; but never before had I been favored
by nocturnal visions of such clarity and surpassing loveliness. The
interior of the palace was full of a luxury that verged upon the
barbaric, and which evidently belonged to the period of Greek
decadence, with its intermingling of Oriental influences. I was led
through a hallway gIeaming with onyx and polished porphyry, into an
opulently furnished room, where, on a couch of gorgeous fabrics, there
reclined a woman of goddess-like beauty.</p>

<p>At sight of her, I trembled from head to foot with the violence of
a strange emotion. I had heard of the sudden mad loves by which men
are seized on beholding for the first time a certain face and form;
but never before had I experienced a passion of such intensity, such
all-consuming ardor, as the one I conceived immediately for this
woman. Indeed, it seemed as if I had loved her for a long time,
without knowing that it was she whom I loved, and without being able
to identify the nature of my enotion or to orient the feeling in any
manner.</p>

<p>She was not tall, but was formed with exquisite voluptuous purity
of line and contour. Her eyes were of a dark sapphire blue, with
molten depths into which the soul was fain to plunge as into the soft
abysses of a summer ocean. The curve of her lips was enigmatic, a
little mournful, and gravely tender as the lips of an antique
Venus. Her hair, brownish rather than blond, fell over her neck and
ears and forehead in delicious ripples confined by a plain fillet of
silver. In her expression, there was a mixture of pride and
voluptuousness, of regal imperiousness and feminine yielding. Her
moverneats were all as efFortless and graceful as those of a
serpent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you would come,&rdquo; she murmured in the same softvoweled
Greek I had heard from the lips of her servants. &ldquo;I have waited for
you long; but when you sought refuge from the storm in the abbey of
Perigon, and saw the manuscript in the secret drawer, I knew that the
hour of your arrival was at hand. Ah! you did not dream that the spell
which drew you so irresistibly, with such unaccountable potency, was
the spell of my beauty, the magical allurement of my love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I queried. I spoke readily in Greek, which
would have surprised me greatly an hour before. But now, I was
prepared to accept anything whatever, no matter how fantastic or
preposterous, as part of the miraculous fortune, the unbelievable
adventure which had befallen me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Nycea,&rdquo; she replied to my question. &ldquo;I love you, and
the hospitality of my palace and of my arms is at your disposal. Need
you know anything nore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slaves had disappeared. I flung myself beside the couch and
kissed the hand she ofered me, pouring out protestations that were no
doubt incoherent, but were nevertheless full of an ardor that made her
smile tenderly. Her hand was cool to my lips, but the touch of it
fired my passion. I ventured to seat myself beside her on the couch,
and she did not deny my familiarity. While a soft purple twilight
began to fill the corners of the chamber, we conversed happily, saying
over and over again all the sweet absurd litanies, all the felicitous
nothings that come instinctively to the lips of lovers. She was
incredibly soft in my arms, and it seemed almost as if the
completeness of her yielding was unhindered by the presence of bones
in her lovely body.</p>

<p>The servants entered noiselessly, lighting rich lamps of
intricately carven gold, and setting before us a meal of spicy meats,
of unknown savorous fruits and potent wines. But I could eat little,
and while I drank, I thirsted for the sweeter wine of Nycea's
mouth.</p>

<p>I do not know when we fell asleep; but the evening had flown like
an enchanted moment. Heavy with felicity, I drifted off on a silken
tide of drowsiness, and the golden lamps and the face of Nycea blurred
in a blissful mist and were seen no more.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the depths of a slumber beyond all dreams, I found
myself compelled into full wakefulness. For an instant, I did not even
realize where I was, still less what had aroused me. Then I heard a
footfall in the open doorway of the room, and peering across the
sleeping head of Nycea, saw in the lamplight the abbot Hilaire, who
had paused on the threshold, A look of absolute horror was imprinted
upon his face, and as he caught sight of me, he began to gibber in
Latin, in tones where something of fear was blended with fanatical
abhorrence and hatred. I saw that he carried in his hands a large
bottle and an aspergillus. I felt sure that the bottle was full of
holy water, and of course divined the use for which it was
intended.</p>

<p>Looking at Nycea, I saw that she too was awake, and knew that she
was aware of the abbot's presence. She gave me a strange smile, in
which I read an affectionate pity, mingled with the reassurance that a
woman offers a frightened child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not fear for me,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foul vampire! accursed lamia! she-serpent of hell!&rdquo; thundered
the abbot suddenly, as he crossed the threshold of the room, raising
the aspergillus aloft. At the same moment, Nycea glided from the
couch, with an unbelievable swiftness of motion, and vanished through
an outer door that gave upon the forest of laurels. Her voice hovered
in my ear, seeming to come from an immense distance:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell for awhile, Christophe. But have no fear. You shall
find me again if you are brave and patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the words ended, the holy water from the aspergillus fell on the
floor of the chamber and on the couch where Nycea had lain beside
me. There was a crash as of many thunders, and the golden lamps went
out in a darkness that seemed full of falling dust, of raining
fragments. I lost all consciousness, and when I recovered, I found
myself lying on a heap of rubble in one of the vaults I had traversed
earlier in the day. With a taper in his hand, and an expression of
great solicitude, of infinite pity upon his face, Hilaire was stooping
over me. Beside him lay the bottle and the dripping aspergillus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank God, my son, that I found you in good time,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;When I returned to the abbey this evening and learned that
you were gone, I surmised all that had happened. I knew you had read
the accursed manuscript in my absence, and had fallen under its
baleful spell, as have so many others, even to a certain reverend
abbot, one of my predecessors. All of them, alas! beginning hundreds
of years ago with Gerard de Venteillon, have fallen victims to the
lamia who dwells in these vaults.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lamia?&rdquo; I questioned, hardly comprehending his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son, the beautiful Nycea who lay in your arms this night
is a lamia, an ancient vampire, who maintains in these noisome vaults
her palace of beatific illusions. How she came to take up her abode at
Faussesflammes is not known, for her coming antedates the memory of
men. She is old as paganism; the Greeks knew her; she was exorcised by
Apollonius of Tyana; and if you could behold her as she really is, you
would see, in lieu of her voluptuous body, the folds of a foul and
monstrous serpent. All those whom she loves and admits to her
hospitality, she devours in the end, after she has drained them of
life and vigor with the diabolic delight of her kisses. The
laurel-wooded plain you saw, the ilex-bordered river, the marble
palace and all the luxury therein, were no more than a satanic
delusion, a lovely bubble that rose from the dust and mold of
immemorial death, of ancient corruption. They crumbled at the kiss of
the holy water I brought with me when I followed you. But Nycea, alas!
has escaped, and I fear she will still survive, to build again her
palace of demoniacal enchantments, to commit again and again the
unspeakable abomination of her sins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still in a sort of stupor at the ruin of my new-found happiness, at
the singular revelations made by the abbot, I followed him obediently
as he led the way through the vaults of Faussesflammes. He mounted the
stairway by which I had descended, and as he neared the top and was
forced to stoop a little, the great flagstone swung upward, letting in
a stream of chill moonlight. We emerged; and I permitted him to take
me back to the monastery.</p>

<p>As my brain began to clear, and the confusion into which I had been
thrown resolved itself, a feeling of resentment grew apace &mdash; a
keen anger at the interference of Hilaire. Unheedful whether or not he
had rescued me from dire physical and spiritual perils, I lamented the
beautiful dream of which he had deprived me. The kisses of Nycea
burned softly in my memory, and I knew that whatever she was, woman or
demon or serpent, there was no one in all the world who could ever
arouse in me the same love and the same delight. I took care, however,
to conceal my feellings fron Hilaire, realizing that a betrayal of
such emotions would merely lead him to look upon me as a soul that was
lost beyond redemption.</p>

<p>On the morrow, pleading the urgency of my return home, I departed
from Perigon. Now, in the library of my father's house near Moulins, I
write this account of my adventures. The memory of Nycea is magically
clear, ineffably dear as if she were still beside me, and still I see
the rich draperies of a midnight chamber illumined by lamps of
curiously carven gold, and still I hear the words of her farewell:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no fear. You shall find me again if you are brave and
patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon I shall return, to visit again the ruins of the Chateau des
Faussesflammes, and redescend into the vaults below the triangular
flagstone. But, in spite of the nearness of Perigon to Faussesflammes,
in spite of my esteem for the abbot, my gratitude for his hospitality
and my admiration for his incomparable library, I shall not care to
revisit my friend Hilaire.</p>
