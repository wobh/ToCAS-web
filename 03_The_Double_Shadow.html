<h1>The Double Shadow</h1>
<h2>Clark Ashton Smith</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>My name is Pharpetron, among those who have known me in Poseidonis;
but even I, the last and most forward pupil of the wise Avyctes, know
not the name of that which I am fated to become ere
to-morrow. Therefore, by the ebbing silver lamps, in my master's
marble house above the loud, ever-ravening sea, I write this tale with
a hasty hand, scrawling an ink of wizard virtue on the grey,
priceless, antique parchment of dragons. And having written, I shall
enclose the pages in a sealed cylinder of orichalchum, and shall cast
the cylinder from a high window into the sea, lest that which I am
doomed to become should haply destroy the writing. And it may be that
mariners from Lephara, passing to Umb and Pneor in their tall
triremes, will find the cylinder; or fishers will draw it from the
wave in their seines of byssus; and having read my story, men will
learn the truth and take warning; and no man's feet, henceforward,
will approach the pale and demon-haunted house of Avyctes.</p>

<p>For six years, I have dwelt apart with the aged master, forgetting
youth and its wonted desires in the study of arcanic things. Together,
we have delved more deeply than all others before us in an interdicted
lore; we have solved the keyless hieroglyphs that guard ante-human
formulae; we have talked with the prehistoric dead; we have called up
the dwellers in sealed crypts, in fearful abysses beyond space. Few
are the sons of mankind who have cared to seek us out among the
desolate, wind-worn crags; and many, but nameless, are the visitants
who have come to us from further bourns of place and time.</p>

<p>Stern and white as a tomb, older than the memory of the dead, and
built by men or devils beyond the recording of myth, is the mansion in
which we dwell. Far below, on black, naked reefs, the northern sea
climbs and roars indomitably, or ebbs with a ceaseless murmur as of
armies of baffled demons; and the house is filled evermore, like a
hollow-sounding sepulcher, with the drear echo of its tumultuous
voices; and the winds wail in dismal wrath around the high towers, but
shake them not. On the seaward side, the mansion rises sheerly from
the straight-falling cliff; but on the other sides there are narrow
terraces, grown with dwarfish, crooked cedars that bow always beneath
the gale. Giant marble monsters guard the landward portals; and huge
marble women ward the strait porticoes above the sea; and mighty
statues and mummies stand everywhere in the chambers and along the
halls. But, saving these, and the spirits we have summoned, there is
none to companion us; and liches and shadows have been the servitors
of our daily needs.</p>

<p>All men have heard the fame of Avyctes, the sole surviving pupil of
that Malygris who tyrannized in his necromancy over Susran from a
tower of sable stone; Malygris, who lay dead for years while men
believed him living; who, lying thus, still uttered potent spells and
dire oracles with decaying lips. But Avyctes lusted not for temporal
power in the manner of Malygris; and having learned all that the elder
sorcerer could teach him, withdrew from the cities of Poseidonis to
seek another and vaster dominion; and I, the youth Pharpetron, in the
latter years of Avyctes, was permitted to join him in this solitude;
and since then, I have shared his austerities and vigils and
evocations &hellip; and now, likewise, I must share the weird doom
that has come in answer to his summoning.</p>

<p>Not without terror (since man is but mortal) did I, the neophyte,
behold at first the abhorrent and tremendous faces of them that obeyed
Avyctes: the genii of the sea and earth, of the stars and the heavens,
who passed to and fro in his marmorean halls. I shuddered at the black
writhing of submundane things from the many-volumed smoke of the
braziers; I cried in horror at the grey foulnesses, colossal, without
form, that crowded malignly about the drawn circle of seven colors,
threatening unspeakable trespass on us that stood at the center. Not
without revulsion did I drink wine that was poured by cadavers, and
eat bread that was purveyed by phantoms. But use and custom dulled the
strangeness, destroyed the fear; and in time I believed implicitly
that Avyctes was the lord of all incantations and exorcisms, with
infallible power to dismiss the beings he evoked.</p>

<p>Well had it had been for Avyctes&mdash;and for me&mdash;if the
master had contented himself with the lore preserved from Atlantis and
Thule, or brought over from Mu and Mayapan. Surely this should have
been enough: for in the ivory-sheeted books of Thule there were
blood-writ runes that would call the demons of the fifth and seventh
planets, if spoken aloud at the hour of their ascent; and the
sorcerers of Mu had left record of a process whereby the doors of
far-future time could be unlocked; and our fathers, the Atlanteans,
had known the road between the atoms and the path into far stars, and
had held speech with the spirits of the sun. But Avyctes thirsted for
a darker knowledge, a deeper empery; and into his hands, in the third
year of my novitiate, there came the mirror-bright tablet of the lost
serpent-people.</p>

<p>Strange, and apparently fortuitous, was our finding of the
tablet. At certain hours, when the tide had fallen from the steep
rocks, we were wont to descend by cavern-hidden stairs to a
cliff-walled crescent beach behind the promontory on which stood the
house of Avyctes. There, on the dun, wet sands, beyond the foamy
tongues of the surf, would lie the worn and curious driftage of alien
shores, and trove that hurricanes had cast up from unsounded
deeps. And there we had found the purple and sanguine volutes of great
shells, and rude lumps of ambergris, and white flowers of perpetually
blooming coral; and once, the barbaric idol of green brass that had
been the figurehead of a galley from far hyperboreal isles.</p>

<p>There had been a great storm, such as must have riven the sea to
its nethermost profound; but the tempest had gone by with morning, and
the heavens were cloudless on that fatal day when we found the tablet,
and the demon winds were hushed among the high crags and chasms; and
the sea lisped with a low whisper, like the rustle of gowns of samite
trailed by fleeing maidens on the sand. And just beyond the ebbing
wave, in a tangle of russet sea-weed, we beheld a thing that glittered
with blinding sun-like brilliance. And running forward, I plucked it
from the wrack before the wave's return, and bore it to Avyctes.</p>

<p>The tablet was wrought of some nameless metal, like never-rusting
iron, but heavier. It had the form of a triangle and was broader at
the widest than a man's heart. On one side it was wholly blank; and
Avyctes and I, in turn, beheld our features mirrored strangely, like
the drawn, pallid features of the dead, in its burnished surface. On
the other side many rows of small crooked ciphers were incised deeply
in the metal, as if by the action of some mordant acid; and these
ciphers were not the pictorial symbols or alphabetic characters of any
language known to the master or to me.</p>

<p>Of the tablet's age and origin, likewise, we could form no
conjecture; and our erudition was altogether baffled. For many days
thereafter we studied the writing and held argument that came to no
issue. And night by night, in a high chamber closed against the
perennial winds, we pondered over the dazzling triangle by the tall
straight flames of silver lamps. For Avyctes deemed that knowledge of
rare value (or haply some secret of an alien or elder magic) was
holden by the clueless crooked ciphers. Then, since all our
scholarship was in vain, the master sought another divination, and had
recourse to wizardy and necromancy. But at first, among the devils and
phantoms that answered our interrogation, none could tell us aught
concerning the tablet. And any other than Avyctes would have despaired
in the end &hellip; and well would it have been if he had despaired,
and had sought no longer to decipher the writing &hellip;.</p>

<p>The months and years went by with a slow thundering of seas on the
dark rocks, and a headlong clamor of winds around the white
towers. Still we continued our delvings and evocations; and further,
always further we went into lampless realms of space and spirit;
learning, perchance, to unlock the hithermost of the manifold
infinities. And at whiles, Avyctes would resume his pondering of the
sea-found tablet; or would question some visitant from other spheres
of time and place regarding its interpretation.</p>

<p>At last, by the use of a chance formula, in idle experiment, he
summoned up the dim, tenuous ghost of a sorcerer from prehistoric
years; and the ghost, in a thin whisper of uncouth, forgotten speech,
informed us that the letters on the tablet were those of a language of
the serpent-men, whose primordial continent had sunk aeons before the
lifting of Hyperborea from the ooze. But the ghost could tell us
naught of their significance; for, even in his time, the
serpent-people had become a dubious legend; and their deep, ante-
human lore and sorcery were things irretrievable by man.</p>

<p>Now, in all the books of conjuration owned by Avyctes, there was no
spell whereby we could call the lost serpent-men from their fabulous
epoch. But there was an old Lemurian formula, recondite and uncertain,
by which the shadow of a dead man could be sent into years posterior
to those of his own life-time, and could be recalled after an interim
by the wizard. And the shade, being wholly insubstantial, would suffer
no harm from the temporal transition, and would remember, for the
information of the wizard, that which he had been instructed to learn
during the journey.</p>

<p>So, having called again the ghost of the prehistoric sorcerer,
wnose name was Ybith, Avyctes made a singular use of several very
ardent gums and combustible fragments of fossil wood; and he and I,
reciting the responses to the formula, sent the thin spirit of Ybith
into the far ages of the serpent-men. And after a time which the
master deemed sufficient, we performed the curious rites of
incantation that would recall Ybith from his alienage. And the rites
were successful; and Ybith stood before us again, like a blown vapor
that is nigh to vanishing. And in words that were faint as the last
echo of perishing memories, the specter told us the key to the meaning
of the letters, which he had learned in the primeval past; and after
this, we questioned Ybith no more, but suffered him to return unto
slumber and oblivion.</p>

<p>Then, knowing the import of the tiny, twisted ciphers, we read the
writing on the tablet and made thereof a transliteration, though not
without labor and difficulty, since the very phonetics of the serpent
tongue, and the symbols and ideas expressed in the writing, were
somewhat alien to those of mankind. And when we had mastered the
inscription, we found that it contained the formula for a certain
evocation which, no doubt, had been used by the serpent sorcerers. But
the object of the evocation was not named; nor was there any clue to
the nature or identity of that which would come in answer to the
rites. And moreover there was no corresponding rite of exorcism nor
spell of dismissal.</p>

<p>Great was the jubilation of Avyctes, deeming that we had learned a
lore beyond the memory or prevision of man. And though I sought to
dissuade him, he resolved to employ the evocation, arguing that our
discovery was no chance thing but was fatefully predestined from the
beginning. And he seemed to think lightly of the menace that might be
brought upon us by the conjuration of things whose nativity and
attributes were wholly obscure. <q>For,</q> said Avyctes, <q>I have
called up, in all the years of my sorcery, no god or devil, no demon
or lich or shadow, which I could not control and dismiss at will. And
I am loath to believe that any power or spirit beyond the subversion
of my spells could have been summoned by a race of serpents, whatever
their skill in demonism and necromancy.</q></p>

<p>So, seeing that he was obstinate, and aeknowledging him for my
master in all ways, I consented to aid Avyctes in the experiment,
though not without dire misgivings. And then we gathered together, in
the chamber of conjuration, at the specified hour and configuration of
the stars, the equivalents of sundry rare materials that the tablet
had instructed us to use in the ritual.</p>

<p>Of much that we did, and of certain agents that we employed, it
were better not to tell; nor shall I record the shrill, sibilant
words, difficult for beings not born of serpents to articulate, whose
intonation formed a signal part of the ceremony. Toward the last, we
drew a triangle on the marble floor with the fresh blood of birds; and
Avyctes stood at one angle, and I at another; and the gaunt umber
mummy of an Atlantean warrior, whose name had been Oigos, was
stationed at the third angle. And standing thus, Avyctes and I held
tapers of corpse-tallow in our hands, till the tapers had burned down
between our fingers as into a socket. And in the outstretched palms of
the mummy of Oigos, as if in shallow thuribles, talc and asbestos
burned, ignited by a strange fire whereof we knew the secret. At one
side we had traced on the floor an infrangible ellipse, made by an
endless linked repetition of the twelve unspeakable Signs of Oumor, to
which we could retire if the visitant should prove inimical or
rebellious. We waited while the pole-circling stars went over, as had
been prescribed. Then, when the tapers had gone out between our seared
fingers, and the talc and asbestos were wholly consumed in the mummy's
eaten palms, Avyctes uttered a single word whose sense was obscure to
us; and Oigos, being animated by sorcery and subject to our will,
repeated the word after a given interval, in tones that were hollow as
a tomb-born echo; and I in my turn also repeated it.</p>

<p>Now, in the chamber of evocation, before beginning the ritual, we
had opened a small window giving upon the sea, and had likewise left
open a high door on the hall to landward, lest that which came in
answer to us should require a spatial mode of entrance. And during the
ceremony, the sea became still and there was no wind, and it seemed
that all things were hushed in awful expectation of the nameless
visitor. But after all was done, and the last word had been repeated
by Oigos and me, we stood and waited vainly for a visible sign or
other manifestation. The lamps burned stilly in the midnight room; and
no shadows fell, other than were cast by ourselves and Oigos and by
the great marble women along the walls. And in the magic mirrors we
had placed cunningly, to reflect those that were otherwise unseen, we
beheld no breath or trace of any image.</p>

<p>At this, after a reasonable interim, Avyctes was sorely
disappointed, deeming that the evocation had failed of its purpose;
and I, having the same thought, was secretly relieved. And we
questioned the mummy of Oigos, to learn if he had perceived in the
room, with such senses as are peculiar to the dead, the sure token or
doubtful proof of a presence undescried by us the living. And the
mummy gave a necromantic answer, saying that there was nothing.</p>

<p><q>Verily,</q> said Avyctes, <q>it were useless to wait
longer. For surely in some way we have misunderstood the purport of
the writing, or have failed to duplicate the matters used in the
evocation, or the correct intonement of the words. Or it may be that
in the lapse of so many aeons, the thing that was formerly wont to
respond has long ceased to exist, or has altered in its attributes so
that the spell is now void and valueless.</q> To this I assented
readily, hoping that the matter was at an end. So, after erasing the
blood-marked triangle and the sacred ellipse of the linked Signs of
Oumor, and after dismissing Oigos to his wonted place among other
mummies, we retired to sleep. And in the days that followed, we
resumed our habitual studies, but made no mention to each other of the
strange triangular tablet or the vain formula.</p>

<p>Even as before, our days went on; and the sea climbed and roared in
white fury on the cliffs, and the winds wailed by in their unseen,
sullen wrath, bowing the dark cedars as witches are bowed by the
breath of Taaran, god of evil. Almost, in the marvel of new tests and
cantraips, I forgot the ineffectual conjuration, and I deemed that
Avyctes had also forgotten it.</p>

<p>All things were as of yore, to our sorcerous perception; and there
was naught to trouble us in our wisdom and power and serenity, which
we deemed secure above the sovereignty of kings. Reading the
horoscopic stars, we found no future ill in their aspect; nor was any
shadow of bale foreshown to us through geomancy, or other modes of
divination such as we employed. And our familiars, though grisly and
dreadful to mortal gaze, were wholly obedient to us the masters.</p>

<p>Then, on a clear summer afternoon, we walked, as was often our
custom, on the marble terrace behind the house. In robes of
ocean-purple, we paced among the windy trees with their blown, crooked
shadows; and there, following us as we went to and fro, I saw the blue
shadow of Avyctes and my own shadow on the marble; and between them,
an adumbration that was not wrought by any of the cedars. And I was
greatly startled, but spoke not of the matter to Avyctes, and observed
the unknown shadow with covert care.</p>

<p>I saw that it followed closely the shadow of Avyctes, keeping ever
the same distance. And it fluttered not in the wind, but moved with a
flowing as of some heavy, thick, putrescent liquid; and its color was
not blue nor purple nor black, nor any other hue to which man's eyes
are habituated, but a hue as of some unearthly purulence; and its form
was altogether monstrous, having a squat head and a long, undulant
body, without similitude to beast or devil.</p>

<p>Avyctes heeded not the shadow; and still I feared to speak, though
I thought it an ill thing for the master to be companioned thus. And I
moved closer to him, in order to detect by touch or other perception
the invisible presence that had cast the adumbration. But the air was
void to sunward of the shadow; and I found nothing opposite the sun
nor in any oblique direction, though I searched closely, knowing that
certain beings cast their shadows thus.</p>

<p>After a while, at the customary hour, we returned by the coiling
stairs and monster-flanked portals into the high house. And I saw that
the strange adumbration moved ever behind the shadow of Avyctes,
falling horrible and unbroken on the steps and passing clearly
separate and distinct amid the long umbrages of the towering
monsters. And in the dim halls beyond the sun, where shadows should
not have been, I beheld with terror the distorted loathly blot, having
a pestilent, unnamable hue, that followed Avyctes as if in lieu of his
own extinguished shadow. And all that day, everywhere that we went, at
the table served by specters, or in the mummy-warded room of volumes
and books, the thing pursued Avyctes, clinging to him even as leprosy
to the leper. And still the master had perceived it not; and still I
forbore to warn him, hoping that the visitant would withdraw in its
own time, going obscurely as it had come.</p>

<p>But at midnight, when we sat together by the silver lamps,
pondering the blood-writ runes of Hyperborea, I saw that the shadow
had drawn closer to the shadow of Avyctes, towering behind his chair
on the wall between the huge sculptured women and the mummies. And the
thing was a streaming ooze of charnel pollution, a foulness beyond the
black leprosies of hell; and I could bear it no more; and I cried out
in my fear and loathing, and informed the master of its presence.</p>

<p>Beholding now the shadow, Avyctes considered it closesly and in
silence; and there was neither fear nor awe nor abhorrence in the
deep, graven wrinkles of his visage. And he said to me at last:</p>

<p><q>This thing is a mystery beyond my lore; but never, in all the
practice of my art, has any shadow come to me unbidden. And since all
others of our evocations have found answer ere this, I must deem that
the shadow is a veritable entity, or the sign of an entity, that has
come in belated response to the formula of the serpent-sorcerers,
which we thought powerless and void. And I think it well that we
should now repair to the chamber of conjuration, and interrogate the
shadow in such manner as we may, to inquire its nativity and
purpose.</q></p>

<p>We went forthwith into the chamber of conjuration, and made such
preparations as were both necessary and possible. And when we were
prepared to question it, the unknown shadow had drawn closer still to
the shadow of Avyctes, so that the clear space between the two was no
wider than the thickness of a necromancer's rod.</p>

<p>Now, in all ways that were feasible, we interrogated the shadow,
speaking through our own lips and the lips of mummies and statues. But
there was no determinable answer; and calling certain of the devils
and phantoms that were our familiars, we made question through the
mouths of these, but without result. And all the while, our magic
mirrors were void of any reflection of a presence that might have cast
the shadow; and they that had been our spokesmen could detect nothing
in the room. And there was no spell, it seemed, that had power upon
the visitant. So Avyctes became troubled; and drawing on the floor
with blood and ashes the ellipse of Oumor, wherein no demon nor spirit
may intrude, he retired to its center. But still within the ellipse,
like a flowing taint of liquid corruption, the shadow followed his
shadow; and the space between the two was no wider than the thickness
of a wizard's pen.</p>

<p>Now, on the face of Avyctes, horror had graven new wrinkles; and
his brow was beaded with a deathly sweat. For he knew, even as I, that
this was a thing beyond all laws, and foreboding naught but disaster
and evil. And he cried to me in a shaken voice, and said:</p>

<p><q>I have no knowledge of this thing nor its intention toward me,
and no power to stay its progress. Go forth and leave me now; for I
would not that any man should witness the defeat of my sorcery and the
doom that may follow thereupon. Also, it were well to depart while
there is time, lest you too should become the quarry of the shadow and
be compelled to share its menace.</q></p>

<p>Though terror had fastened upon my inmost soul, I was loath to
leave Avyctes. But I had sworn to obey his will at all times and in
every respect; and moreover I knew myself doubly powerless against the
adumbration, since Avyctes himself was impotent.</p>

<p>So, bidding him farewell, I went forth with trembling limbs from
the haunted chamber; and peering back from the threshold, I saw that
the alien umbrage, creeping like a noisome blotch on the floor, had
touched the shadow of Avyctes. And at that moment the master shrieked
aloud like one in nightmare; and his face was no longer the face of
Avyctes but was contorted and convulsed like that of some helpless
madman who wrestles with an unseen incubus. And I looked no more, but
fled along the dim outer hall and through the high portals giving upon
the terrace.</p>

<p>A red moon, ominous and gibbous, had declined above the terrace and
the crags; and the shadows of the cedars were elongated in the moon;
and they wavered in the gale like the blown cloaks of enchanters. And
stooping against the gale, I fled across the terrace toward the outer
stairs that led to a steep path in the riven waste of rocks and chasms
behind Avyctes' house. I neared the terrace edge, running with the
speed of fear; but I could not reach the topmost outer stair; for at
every step the marble flowed beneath me, fleeing like a pale horizon
before the seeker. And though I raced and panted without pause, I
could draw no nearer to the terrace edge.</p>

<p>At length I desisted, seeing that an unknown spell had altered the
very space about the house of Avyctes, so that none could escape
therefrom to landward. So, resigning myself in despair to whatever
might befall, I returned toward the house. And climbing the white
stairs in the low, level beams of the crag-caught moon, I saw a figure
that awaited me in the portals. And I knew by the trailing robe of
sea-purple, but by no other token, that the figure was Avyctes. For
the face was no longer in its entirety the face of man, but was become
a loathly fluid amalgam of human features with a thing not to be
identified on earth. The transfiguration was ghastlier than death or
the changes of decay; and the face was already hued with the nameless,
corrupt and purulent color of the strange shadow, and had taken on, in
respect to its outlines, a partial likeness to the squat profile of
the shadow. The hands of the figure were not those of any terrene
being; and the shape beneath the robe had lengthened with a nauseous
undulant pliancy; and the face and fingers seemed to drip in the moon-
light with a deliquescent corruption. And the pursuing umbrage, like a
thickly flowing blight, had corroded and distorted the very shadow of
Avyctes, which was now double in a manner not to be narrated here.</p>

<p>Fain would I have cried or spoken aloud; but horror had dried up
the fount of speech. And the thing that had been Avyctes beckoned me
in silence, uttering no word from its living and putrescent lips. And
with eyes that were no longer eyes, but had become an oozing
abomination, it peered steadily upon me. And it clutched my shoulder
closely with the soft leprosy of its fingers, and led me half-swooning
with revulsion along the hall, and into that room where the mummy of
Oigos, who had assisted us in the threefold incantation of the
serpent-men, was stationed with several of his fellows.</p>

<p>By the lamps which illumed the chamber, burning with pale, still,
perpetual flames, I saw that the mummies stood erect along the wall in
their exanimate repose, each in his wonted place with his tall shadow
beside him. But the great, gaunt shadow of Oigos on the marble wall
was companioned by an adumbration similar in all respects to the evil
thing that had followed the master and was now incorporate with him. I
remembered that Oigos had performed his share of the ritual, and had
repeated an unknown stated word in turn after Avyctes; and so I knew
that the horror had come to Oigos in turn, and would wreak itself upon
the dead even as on the living. For the foul, anonymous thing that we
had called in our presumption could manifest itself to mortal ken in
no other way than this. We had drawn it from unfathomable depths of
time and space, using ignorantly a dire formula; and the thing had
come at its own chosen hour, to stamp itself in abomination uttermost
on the evocators.</p>

<p>Since then, the night has ebbed away, and a second day has gone by
like a sluggish ooze of horror&hellip;. I have seen the complete
identification of the shadow with the flesh and the shadow of Avyctes
&hellip; and also I have seen the slow encroachment of that other
umbrage, mingling itself with the lank shadow and the sere, bituminous
body of Oigos, and turning them to a similitude of the thing which
Avyctes has become. And I have heard the mummy cry out like a living
man in great pain and fear, as with the throes of a second
dissolution, at the impingement of the shadow. And long since it has
grown silent, like the other horror, and I know not its thoughts or
its intent&hellip;. And verily I know not if the thing that has come
to us be one or several; nor if its avatar will rest complete with the
three that summoned it forth into time, or be extended to others.</p>

<p>But these things, and much else, I shall soon know; for now, in
turn, there is a shadow that follows mine, drawing ever closer. The
air congeals and curdles with an unseen fear; and they that were our
familiars have fled from the mansion; and the great marble women seem
to tremble where they stand along the walls. But the horror that was
Avyctes, and the second horror that was Oigos, have left me not, and
neither do they tremble. And with eyes that are not eyes, they seem to
brood and watch, waiting till I too shall become as they. And their
stillness is more terrible than if they had rended me limb from
limb. And there are strange voices in the wind, and alien roarings
upon the sea; and the walls quiver like a thin veil in the black
breath of remote abysses.</p>

<p>So, knowing that the time is brief, I have shut myself in the room
of volumes and books and have written this account. And I have taken
the bright triangular tablet, whose solution was our undoing, and have
cast it from the window into the sea, hoping that none will find it
after us. And now I must make an end, and enclose this writing in the
sealed cylinder of orichalchum, and fling it forth to drift upon the
wave. For the space between my shadow and the shadow of the horror is
straitened momently&hellip;. and the space is no wider than the
thickness of a wizard's pen.</p>
