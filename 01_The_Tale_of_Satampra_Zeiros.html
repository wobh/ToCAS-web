<h1>The Tale of Satampra Zeiros</h1>
<h2>Clark Ashton Smith</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>I, Satampra Zeiros of Uzuldaroum, shall write with my left hand,
since I have no longer any other, the tale of everything that befell
Tirouv Ompallios and myself in the shrine of the god Tsathoggua, which
lies neglected by the worship of man in the jungle-taken suburbs of
Commoriom, that long-deserted capital of the Hyperborean rulers. I
shall write it with the violet juice of the <em>suvana-</em>palm,
which turns to a blood-red rubric with the passage of years, on a
strong vellum that is made from the skin of the mastodon, as a warning
to all good thieves and adventurers who may hear some lying legend of
the lost treasures of Commoriom and be tempted thereby.</p>

<p>Now, Tirouv Ompallios was my life-long friend and my trustworthy
companion in all such enterprises as require deft fingers and a habit
of mind both agile and adroit. I can say without flattering myself, or
Tirouv Ompallios either, that we carried to an incomparable success
more than one undertaking from which fellow-craftsmen of a much wider
renown than ourselves might well have recoiled in dismay. To be more
explicit, I refer to the theft of the jewels of Queen Cunambria, which
were kept in a room where two-score venomous reptiles wandered at
will; and the breaking of the adamantine box of Acromi, in which were
all the medallions of an early dynasty of Hyperborean kings. It is
true that these medallions were difficult and perilous to dispose of,
and that we sold them at a dire sacrifice to the captain of a
barbarian vessel from remote Lemuria: but nevertheless, the breaking
of that box was a glorious feat, for it had to be done in absolute
silence, on account of the proximity of a dozen guards who were all
armed with tridents. We made use of a rare and mordant acid &hellip;
but I must not linger too long and too garrulously by the way, however
great the temptation to ramble on amid heroic memories and the high
glamor of valiant or sleightful deeds.</p>

<p>In our occupation, as in all others, the vicissitudes of fortune
are oftentimes to be reckoned with; and the goddess Chance is not
always prodigal of her favors. So it was that Tirouv Ompallios and I,
at the time of which I write, had found ourselves in a condition of
pecuniary depletion, which, though temporary, was nevertheless
extreme, and was quite inconvenient and annoying, coming as it did on
the heel of more prosperous days, of more profitable midnights. People
had become accursedly chary of their jewels and other valuables,
windows and doors were double-barred, new and perplexing locks were in
use, guards had grown more vigilant or less somnolent,&mdash;in short,
all the natural difficulties of our profession had multiplied
themselves. At one time we were reduced to the stealing of more bulky
and less precious merchandise than that in which we customarily dealt;
and even this had its dangers. Even now, it humiliates me to remember
the night when we were nearly caught with a sack of red yams; and I
mention all this that I may not seem in any wise vainglorious.</p>

<p>One evening, in an alley of the more humble quarter of Uzuldaroum,
we stopped to count our available resources, and found that we had
between us exactly three pazoors&mdash;enough to buy a large bottle of
pomegranate wine or two loaves of bread. We debated the problem of
expenditure.</p>

<p><q>The bread,</q> contended Tirouv Ompallios, <q>will nurture our
bodies, will lend a new and more expeditious force to our spent limbs,
and our toilworn fingers.</q></p>

<p><q>The pomegranate wine,</q> said I, <q>will ennoble our thoughts,
will inspire and illuminate our minds, and perchance will reveal to us
a mode of escape from our present difficulties.</q></p>

<p>Tirouv Ompallios yielded without undue argument to my superior
reasoning, and we sought the doors of an adjacent tavern. The wine was
not of the best, in regard to flavor, but the quantity and strength
were all that could be desired. We sat in the crowded tavern, and
sipped it at leisure, till all the fire of the bright red liquor had
transferred itself to our brains. The darkness and dubiety of our
future ways became illumined as by the light of rosy cressets, and the
harsh aspect of the world was marvellously softened. Anon, there came
to me an inspiration.</p>

<p><q>Tirouv Ompallios,</q> I said, <q>is there any reason why you and
I, who are brave men and nowise subject to the fears and superstitions
of the multitude, should not avail ourselves of the kingly treasures
of Commoriom? A day's journey from this tiresome town, a pleasant
sojourn in the country, an afternoon or forenoon of archaeological
research&mdash;and who knows what we should find?</q></p>

<p><q>You speak wisely and valiantly, my dear friend,</q> rejoined
Tirouv Ompallios. <q>Indeed, there is no reason why we should not
replenish our deflated finances at the expense of a few dead kings or
gods.</q></p>

<p>Now Commoriom, as all the world knows, was deserted many hundred
years ago because of the prophecy of the White Sybil of Polarion, who
foretold an undescribed and abominable doom for all mortal beings who
should dare to tarry within its environs. Some say that this doom was
a pestilence that would have come from the northern waste by the paths
of the jungle tribes; others, that it was a form of madness; at any
rate, no one, neither king nor priest nor merchant nor laborer nor
thief, remained in Commoriom to abide its arrival, but all departed in
a single migration to found at the distance of a day's journey the new
capital, Uzuldaroum. And strange tales are told, of horrors and
terrors not to be faced or overcome by man, that haunt forevermore the
shrines and mausoleums and palaces of Commoriom. And still it stands,
a luster of marble, a magnificence of granite, all a-throng with
spires and cupolas and obelisks that the mighty trees of the jungle
have not yet overtowered, in a fertile inland valley of
Hyperborea. And men say that in its unbroken vaults there lies entire
and undespoiled as of yore the rich treasure of olden monarchs; that
the high-built tombs retain the gems and electrum that were buried
with their mummies; that the fanes have still their golden
altar-vessels and furnishings, the idols their precious stones in ear
and mouth and nostril and navel.</p>

<p>I think that we should have set out that very night, if we had only
had the encouragement and inspiration of a second bottle of
pomegranate wine. As it was, we decided to start at early dawn: the
fact that we had no funds for our journey was of small moment, for,
unless our former dexterity had altogether failed us, we could levy a
modicum of involuntary tribute from the guileless folk of the
country-side. In the meanwhile, we repaired to our lodgings, where the
landlord met us with a grudging welcome and a most ungracious demand
for his money. But the golden promise of the morrow had armed us
against all such trivial annoyances, and we waved the fellow aside
with a disdain that appeared to astonish if not to subdue him.</p>

<p>We slept late, and the sun had ascended far upon the azure
acclivity of the heavens when we left the gates of Uzuldaroum and took
the northern road that leads toward Commoriom. We breakfasted well on
some amber melons, and a stolen fowl that we cooked in the woods, and
then resumed our wayfaring. In spite of a fatigue that increased upon
us toward the end of the day, our trip was a pleasurable one, and we
found much to divert us in the varying landscapes through which we
passed, and in their people. Some of these people, I am sure, must
still remember us with regret, for we did not deny ourselves anything
procurable that tempted our fancy or our appetites.</p>

<p>It was an agreeable country, full of farms and orchards and running
waters and green, flowery woods. At last, somewhile in the course of
the afternoon, we came to the ancient road, long disused and well-nigh
overgrown, which runs from the highway through the elder jungle to
Commoriom.</p>

<p>No one saw us enter this road, and thenceforward we met no one. At
a single step, we passed from all human ken; and it seemed that the
silence of the forest around us had lain unstirred by mortal footfall
ever since the departure of the legendary king and his people so many
centuries before. The trees were vaster than any we had ever seen,
they were interwoven by the endless labyrinthine volumes, the eternal
web-like convolutions of creepers almost as old as they
themselves. The flowers were unwholesomely large, their petals bore a
lethal pallor or a sanguinary scarlet; and their perfumes were
overpoweringly sweet or fetid. The fruits along our way were of great
size, with purple and orange and russet colors, but somehow we did not
dare to eat them.</p>

<p>The woods grew thicker and more rampant as we went on, and the
road, though paved with granite slabs, was more and more overgrown,
for trees had rooted themselves in the interstices, often forcing the
wide blocks apart. Though the sun had not yet neared the horizon, the
shades that were cast upon us from gigantic boles and branches became
ever denser, and we moved in a dark-green twilight fraught with
oppressive odors of lush growth and of vegetable corruption. There
were no birds nor animals, such as one would think to find in any
wholesome forest, but at rare intervals a stealthy viper with pale and
heavy coils glided away from our feet among the rank leaves of the
roadside, or some enormous moth with baroque and evil-colored
mottlings flew before us and disappeared in the dimness of the
jungle. Abroad already in the half-light, huge purpureal bats with
eyes like tiny rubies arose at our approach from the poisonous-looking
fruits on which they feasted, and watched us with malign attention as
they hovered noiselessly in the air above. And we felt, somehow, that
we were being watched by other and invisible presences; and a sort of
awe fell upon us, and a vague fear of the monstrous jungle; and we no
longer spoke aloud, or frequently, but only in rare whispers.</p>

<p>Among other things, we had contrived to procure along our way a
large leathern bottle full of palm-spirit. A few sips of the ardent
liquor had already served to lighten more than once the tedium of our
journey; and now it was to stand us in good stead. Each of us drank a
liberal draught, and presently the jungle became less awesome; and we
wondered why we had allowed the silence and the gloom, the watchful
bats and the brooding immensity, to weigh upon our spirits even for a
brief while; and I think that after a second draught we began to
sing.</p>

<p>When twilight came, and a waxing moon shone high in the heavens
after the hidden daystar had gone down, we were so imbued with the
fervor of adventure that we decided to push on and reach Commoriom
that very night. We supped on food that we had levied from the
country-people, and the leathern bottle passed between us several
times. Then, considerably fortified, and replete with hardihood and
the valor of a lofty enterprise, we resumed our journeying.</p>

<p>Indeed, we had not much farther to go. Even as we were debating
between ourselves, with an ardor that made us oblivious of our long
wayfaring, what costly loot we would first choose from among all the
mythical treasures of Commoriom, we saw in the moonlight the gleam of
marble cupolas above the tree-tops, and then between the boughs and
boles the wan pillars of shadowy porticoes. A few more steps, and we
trod upon paven streets that ran transversely from the high-road we
were following, into the tall, luxuriant woods on either side, where
the fronds of mighty palmferns overtopped the roofs of ancient
houses.</p>

<p>We paused, and again the silence of an elder desolation claimed our
lips. For the houses were white and still as sepulchers, and the deep
shadows that lay around and upon them were chill and sinister and
mysterious as the very shadow of death. It seemed that the sun could
not have shone for ages in this place&mdash;that nothing warmer than
the spectral beams of the cadaverous moon had touched the marble and
granite ever since that universal migration prompted by the prophecy
of the White Sybil of Polarion.</p>

<p><q>I wish it were daylight,</q> murmured Tirouv Ompallios. His low
tones were oddly sibilant, were unnaturally audible in the dead
stillness. <q>Tirouv Ompallios,</q> I replied, <q>I trust that you are
not growing superstitious. I should be loth to think that you are
succumbing to the infantile fancies of the multitude. Howbeit, let us
have another drink.</q></p>

<p>We lightened the leathern bottle appreciably by the demand we now
made upon its contents, and were marvellously cheered thereby&mdash;so
much so, indeed, that we forthwith started to explore a left-hand
avenue, which, though it had been laid out with mathematical
directness, vanished at no great distance among the fronded
trees. Here, somewhat apart from the other buildings, in a sort of
square that the jungle had not yet wholly usurped, we found a small
temple of antique architecture which gave the impression of being far
older even than the adjoining edifices. It also differed from these in
its material, for it was builded of a dark basaltic stone heavily
encrusted with lichens that seemed of a coeval antiquity. It was
square in form, and had no domes nor spires, no fa&ccedil;ade of
pillars, and only a few narrow windows high above the ground. Such
temples are rare in Hyperborea now-a-days; but we knew it for a shrine
of Tsathoggua, one of the elder gods, who receives no longer any
worship from men, but before whose ashen altars, people say, the
furtive and ferocious beasts of the jungle, the ape, the giant sloth
and the long-toothed tiger, have sometimes been seen to make obeisance
and have been heard to howl or whine their inarticulate prayers.</p>

<p>The temple, like the other buildings, was in a state of well-nigh
perfect preservation: the only signs of decay were in the carven
lintel of the door, which had crumbled and splintered away in several
places. The door itself, wrought of a swarthy bronze all overgreened
by time, stood slightly a-jar. Knowing that there should be a jewelled
idol within, not to mention the various altar-pieces of valuable
metals, we felt the urge of temptation.</p>

<p>Surmising that strength might be required to force open the
verdigris-covered door, we drank deeply, and then applied ourselves to
the task. Of course, the hinges were rusted; and only by dint of
mighty and muscular heavings did the door at last begin to move. As we
renewed our efforts, it swung slowly inward with a hideous grating and
grinding that mounted to an almost vocal screech, in which we seemed
to hear the tones of some unhuman entity. The black interior of the
temple yawned before us, and from it there surged an odor of
long-imprisoned mustiness combined with a queer and unfamiliar
fetidity. To this, however, we gave little heed in the natural
excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>With my usual foresight, I had provided myself with a piece of
resinous wood earlier in the day, thinking that it might serve as a
torch in case of any nocturnal explorations of Commoriom. I lit this
torch, and we entered the shrine.</p>

<p>The place was paven with immense quinquangular flags of the same
material from which its walls were built. It was quite bare, except
for the image of the god enthroned at the further end, the two-tiered
altar of obscenely-figured metal before the image, and a large and
curious-looking basin of bronze supported on three legs, which
occupied the middle of the floor. Giving this basin hardly a glance,
we ran forward, and I thrust my torch into the face of the idol.</p>

<p>I had never seen an image of Tsathoggua before, but I recognized
him without difficulty from the descriptions I had heard. He was very
squat and pot-bellied, his head was more like that of a monstrous toad
than a deity, and his whole body was covered with an imitation of
short fur, giving somehow a vague suggestion of both the bat and the
sloth. His sleepy lids were half-lowered over his globular eyes; and
the tip of a queer tongue issued from his fat mouth. In truth, he was
not a comely or personable sort of god, and I did not wonder at the
cessation of his worship, which could only have appealed to very
brutal and aboriginal men at any time.</p>

<p>Tirouv Ompallios and I began to swear simultaneously by the names
of more urbane and civilized deities, when we saw that not even the
commonest of semi-precious gems was visible anywhere, either upon or
within any feature or member of this execrable image. With a
niggardliness beyond parallel, even the eyes had been carven from the
same dull stone as the rest of the abominable thing, and mouth, nose,
ears and all other orifices were unadorned. We could only wonder at
the avarice or poverty of the beings who had wrought this unique
bestiality.</p>

<p>Now that our minds were no longer enthralled by the hope of
immediate riches, we became more keenly aware of our surroundings in
general; and in particular we noticed the unfamiliar fetor I have
spoken of previously, which had now increased uncomfortably in
strength. We found that it came from the bronze basin, which we
proceeded to examine, though without any idea that the examination
would be profitable or even pleasant.</p>

<p>The basin, I have said, was very large; indeed, it was no less than
six feet in diameter by three in depth, and its brim was the height of
a tall man's shoulder from the floor. The three legs that bore it were
curved and massive and terminated in feline paws displaying their
talons. When we approached and peered over the brim, we saw that the
bowl was filled with a sort of viscous and semi-liquescent substance,
quite opaque and of a sooty color. It was from this that the odor came
&mdash;an odor which, though unsurpassably foul, was nevertheless not
an odor of putrefaction, but resembled rather the smell of some vile
and unclean creature of the marshes. The odor was almost beyond
endurance, and we were about to turn away when we perceived a slight
ebullition of the surface, as if the sooty liquid were being agitated
from within by some submerged animal or other entity. This ebullition
increased rapidly, the center swelled as if with the action of some
powerful yeast, and we watched in utter horror, while an uncouth
amorphous head with dull and bulging eyes arose gradually on an
ever-lengthening neck, and stared us in the face with primordial
malignity. Then two arms&mdash;if one could call them
arms&mdash;likewise arose inch by inch, and we saw that the thing was
not, as we had thought, a creature immersed in the liquid, but that
the liquid itself had put forth this hideous neck and head, and was
now forming these damnable arms, that groped toward us with
tentacle-like appendages in lieu of claws or hands!</p>

<p>A fear which we had never experienced even in dreams, of which we
had found no hint in our most perilous nocturnal excursions, deprived
us of the faculty of speech, but not of movement. We recoiled a few
paces from the bowl, and co-incidentally with our steps, the horrible
neck and arms continued to lengthen. Then the whole mass of the dark
fluid began to rise, and far more quickly than
the <em>suvana</em>-juice runs from my pen, it poured over the rim of
the basin like a torrent of black quicksilver, taking as it reached
the floor an undulant ophidian form which immediately developed more
than a dozen short legs.</p>

<p>What unimaginable horror of protoplastic life, what loathly spawn
of the primordial slime had come forth to confront us, we did not
pause to consider or conjecture. The monstrosity was too awful to
permit of even a brief contemplation; also, its intentions were too
plainly hostile, and it gave evidence of anthropophagic inclinations;
for it slithered toward us with an unbelievable speed and celerity of
motion, opening as it came a toothless mouth of amazing capacity. As
it gaped upon us, revealing a tongue that uncoiled like a long
serpent, its jaws widened with the same extreme elasticity that
accompanied all its other movements. We saw that our departure from
the fane of Tsathoggua had become most imperative, and turning our
backs to all the abominations of that unhallowed shrine, we crossed
the sill with a single leap, and ran headlong in the moonlight through
the suburbs of Commoriom. We rounded every convenient corner, we
doubled upon our tracks behind the palaces of time-forgotten nobles
and the ware-houses of unrecorded merchants, we chose preferably the
places where the incursive jungle trees were highest and thickest; and
at last, on a by-road where the outlying houses were no longer
visible, we paused and dared to look back.</p>

<p>Our lungs were intolerably strained, were ready to burst with their
heroic effort, and the various fatigues of the day had told upon us
all too grievously; but when we saw at our heels the black monster,
following us with a serpentine and undulating ease, like a torrent
that descends a long declivity, our flagging limbs were miraculously
re-animated, and we plunged from the betraying light of the by-road
into the pathless jungle, hoping to evade our pursuer in the labyrinth
of boles and vines and gigantic leaves. We stumbled over roots and
fallen trees, we tore our raiment and lacerated our skins on the
savage brambles, we collided in the gloom with huge trunks and limber
saplings that bent before us, we heard the hissing of tree-snakes that
spat their venom at us from the boughs above, and the grunting or
howling of unseen animals when we trod upon them in our precipitate
flight. But we no longer dared to stop or look behind.</p>

<p>We must have continued our headlong peregrinations for hours. The
moon, which had given us little light at best through the heavy
leafage, fell lower and lower among the enormous-fronded palms and
intricate creepers. But its final rays, when it sank, were all that
saved us from a noisome marsh with mounds and hassocks of
bog-concealing grass, amid whose perilous environs and along whose
mephitic rim we were compelled to run without pause or hesitation or
time to choose our footing, with our damnable pursuer dogging every
step.</p>

<p>Now, when the moon had gone down, our flight became wilder and more
hazardous&mdash;a veritable delirium of terror, exhaustion, confusion,
and desperate difficult progression among obstacles to which we gave
no longer any distinct heed or comprehension, through a night that
clung to us and clogged us like an evil load, like the toils of a
monstrous web. It would seem that the creature behind us, with its
unbelievable facilities of motion and self-elongation, could have
overtaken us at any time; but apparently it desired to prolong the
game. And so, in a semi-eternal protraction of inconclusive horrors,
the night wore on &hellip; But we never dared to stop or look
back.</p>

<p>Far-off and wan, a glimmering twilight grew among the trees&mdash;a
foreomening of the hidden morn. Wearier than the dead, and longing for
any repose, any security, even that of some indiscernible tomb, we ran
toward the light, and stumbled forth from the jungle upon a paven
street among marble and granite buildings. Dimly, dully, beneath the
crushing of our fatigue, we realized that we had wandered in a circle
and had come back to the suburbs of Commoriom. Before us, no farther
away than the toss of a javelin, was the dark temple of
Tsathoggua.</p>

<p>Again we ventured to look back, and saw the elastic monster, whose
legs had now lengthened till it towered above us, and whose maw was
wide enough to have swallowed us both at a mouthful. It followed us
with an effortless glide, with a surety of motion and intention too
horrible, too cynical to be borne. We ran into the temple of
Tsathoggua, whose door was still open just as we had left it, and
closing the door behind us with a fearful immediacy, we contrived, in
the superhuman strength of our desperation, to shoot one of the rusty
bolts.</p>

<p>Now, while the chill drearness of the dawn fell down in narrow
shafts through the windows high in the wall, we tried with a truly
heroic resignation to compose ourselves, and waited for whatever our
destiny should bring. And while we waited, the god Tsathoggua peered
upon us with an even more imbecile squatness and vileness and
bestiality than he had shown in the torchlight.</p>

<p>I think I have said that the lintel of the door had crumbled and
splintered away in several places. In fact, the beginning process of
ruin had made three apertures, through which the daylight now
filtered, and which were large enough to have permitted the passage of
small animals or sizable serpents. For some reason, our eyes were
drawn to these apertures.</p>

<p>We had not gazed long, when the light was suddenly intercepted in
all three openings, and then a black material began to pour through
them and ran down the door in a triple stream to the flagstones, where
it re-united and resumed the form of the thing that had followed
us.</p>

<p><q>Farewell, Tirouv Ompallios,</q> I cried, with such remaining breath
as I could summon. Then I ran and concealed myself behind the image of
Tsathoggua, which was large enough to screen me from view, but,
unfortunately, was too small to serve this purpose for more than one
person. Tirouv Ompallios would have preceded me with the same laudable
idea of self-preservation, but I was the quicker. And seeing that
there was not room for both of us to the rearward of Tsathoggua, he
returned my valediction and climbed into the great bronze basin, which
alone could now afford a moment's concealment in the bareness of the
fane.</p>

<p>Peering from behind that execrable god, whose one merit was the
width of his abdomen and his haunches, I observed the actions of the
monster. No sooner had Tirouv Ompallios crouched down in the
three-legged bowl, when the nameless enormity reared itself up like a
sooty pillar and approached the basin. The head had now changed in
form and position, till it was no more than a vague imprint of
features on the middle of a body without arms, legs or neck. The thing
loomed above the brim for an instant, gathering all its bulk in an
imminent mass on a sort of tapering tail, and then like a lapsing wave
it fell into the bowl upon Tirouv Ompallios. Its whole body seemed to
open and form an immense mouth as it sank down from sight.</p>

<p>Hardly able to breathe in my horror, I waited, but no sound and no
movement came from the basin&mdash;not even a groan from Tirouv
Ompallios. Finally, with infinite slowness and trepidation and
caution, I ventured to emerge from behind Tsathoggua, and passing the
bowl on tip-toe, I managed to reach the door.</p>

<p>Now, in order to win my freedom, it would be necessary to draw back
the bolt and open the door. And this I greatly feared to do because of
the inevitable noise. I felt that it would be highly injudicious to
disturb the entity in the bowl while it was digesting Tirouv
Ompallios; but there seemed to be no other way if I was ever to leave
that abominable fane.</p>

<p>Even as I shot back the bolt, a single tentacle sprang out with
infernal rapidity from the basin, and elongating itself across the
whole room, it caught my right wrist in a lethal clutch. It was unlike
anything I have ever touched, it was indescribably viscid and slimy
and cold, it was loathsomely soft like the foul mire of a bog and
mordantly sharp as an edged metal, with an agonizing suction and
constriction that made me scream aloud as the clutch tightened upon my
flesh, cutting into me like a vise of knife-blades. In my struggles to
free myself, I drew the door open, and fell forward on the sill. A
moment of awful pain, and then I became aware that I had broken away
from my captor. But looking down, I saw that my hand was gone, leaving
a strangely withered stump from which little blood issued. Then,
gazing behind me into the shrine, I saw the tentacle recoil and
shorten till it passed from view behind the rim of the basin, bearing
my lost hand to join whatever now remained of Tirouv Ompallios.</p>
