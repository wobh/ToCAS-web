<p>At the hour of interlunar midnight, when lamps burned rarely and
far apart in Susran, and slow-moving autumn clouds had muffled the
stars, King Gadeiron sent forth into the sleeping city twelve of his
trustiest mutes. Like shadows gliding through oblivion, they vanished
upon their various ways; and each of them, returning presently to the
darkened palace, led with him a shrouded figure no less discreet and
silent than himself.</p>

<p>In this manner, groping along tortuous alleys, through blind
cypress-caverns in the royal gardens, and down subterranean halls and
steps, twelve of the most powerful sorcerers of Susran were brought
together in a vault of oozing, death-gray granite, far beneath the
foundations of the palace.</p>

<p>The entrance of the vault was guarded by earth-demons that obeyed
the arch-sorcerer, Maranapion, who had long been the king's
councillor. These demons would have torn limb from limb any who came
unprepared to offer them a libation of fresh blood. The vault was lit
dubiously by a single lamp, hollowed from a monstrous garnet, and fed
with vipers' oil. Here Gadeiron, crownless, and wearing sackcloth dyed
in sober purple, awaited the wizards on a seat of limestone wrought in
the form of a sarcophagus. Maranapion stood at his right hand,
immobile, and swathed to the mouth in the garments of the tomb. Before
him was a tripod of orichalchum, rearing shoulder-high; and on the
tripod, in a silver socket, there reposed the enormous blue eye of a
slain Cyclops, wherein the archimage was said to behold weird
visions. On this eye, gleaming balefully under the garnet lamp, the
gaze of Maranapion was fixed with death-like rigidity.</p>

<p>From these circumstances, the twelve sorcerers knew that the king
had convened them only because of a matter supremely grave and
secret. The hour and fashion of their summoning, the place of meeting,
the terrible elemental guards, the mufti worn by Gadeiron &mdash; all
were proof of a need for preternatural stealth and privity.</p>

<p>For awhile there was silence in the vault, and the twelve, bowing
deferentially, waited the will of Gadeiron. Then, in a voice that was
little more than a harsh whisper, the king spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What know ye of Malygris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hearing that awful name, the sorcerers paled and trembled visibly;
but, one by one, as if speaking by rote, several of the foremost made
answer to Gadeiron's question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Malygris dwells in his black tower above Susran,&rdquo; said the
first. &ldquo;The night of his power is still heavy upon Poseidonis; and
we others, moving in that night, are as shadows of a withered moon. He
is overlord of all kings and sorcerers. Yea, even the triremes that
fare to Tartessos, and the far-flown eagles of the sea, pass not
beyond the black falling of his shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The demons of the five elements are his familiars,&rdquo; said
the second. &ldquo;The gross eyes of common men have beheld them often,
flying like birds about his tower, or crawling lizard-wise on the
walls and pavements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Malygris sits in his high hall,&rdquo; avowed the third. &ldquo;Unto
him, tribute is borne at the full moon from all the cities of
Poseidonis. He takes a tithe of the lading of every galley. He claims
a share of the silver and incense, of the gold and ivory sacred to the
temples. His wealth is beyond the opulence of the sunken kings of
Atlantis&hellip; even those kings who were thy forefathers, O
Gadeiron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Malygris is old as the moon,&rdquo; mumbled a fourth. &ldquo;He will
live for ever, armed against death with the dark magic of the
moon. Death has become a slave in his citadel, toiling among other
slaves, and striking only at the foes of Malygris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much of this was true formerly,&rdquo; quoth the king, with a
sinister hissing of his breath. &ldquo;But now a certain doubt has
arisen&hellip; for it may be that Malygris is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A communicated shiver seemed to run about the
assembly. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the sorcerer who had affirmed the
immortality of Malygris. &ldquo;For how can this thing have come to pass?
The doors of his tower stood open today at sunset; and the priests of
the ocean-god, bearing a gift of pearls and purple dyes, went in
before Malygris, and found him sitting in his tall chair of the ivory
of mastodons. He received them haughtily, without speaking, as is his
wont; and his servants, who are half ape and half man, came in
unbidden to carry away the tribute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This very night,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;I saw the stedfast
lamps of the sable tower, burning above the city like the eyes of
Taaran, god of Evil. The familiars have departed not from the tower as
such beings depart at the dying of a wizard: for in that case, men
would have heard their howling and lamentation in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; declared Gadeiron, &ldquo;men have been befooled ere
this. And Malygris was ever the master of illuding shows, of feints,
and beguilements. But there is one among us who discerns the
truth. Maranapion, through the eye of the Cyclops, has looked on
remote things and hidden places, Even now, he peers upon his ancient
enemy, Malygris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maranapion, shuddering a little beneath his shroud-like garments,
seemed to return from his clairvoyant absorption. He raised from the
tripod his eyes of luminous amber, whose pupils were black and
impenetrable as jet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen Malygris,&rdquo; he said, turning to the
conclave. &ldquo;Many times I have watched him thus,
thinking to learn some secret of his close-hidden magic, I have spied
upon him at noon, at evenfall, and through the drear, lampless vigils
of midnight. And I have beheld him in the ashen dawn and the dawn of
quickening fire. But always he sits in the great ivory chair, in the
high hall of his tower, frowning as if with meditation. And his hands
clutch always the basilisk-carven arms of the chair, and his eyes turn
evermore, unshutting, unblinking, toward the orient window and the
heavens beyond where only high-risen stars and clouds go by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus have I beheld him for the space of a
whole year and a month. And each day I have seen his monsters bring
before him vessels filled with rare meat and drink: and later they
have taken away the vessels untouched. And never have I discerned the
least movement of his lips, nor any turning or tremor of his
body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For these reasons, I deem that Malygris is dead; but by virtue of
his supremacy in evil and in art magical, he sits defying the worm,
still undecayed and incorrupt. And his monsters and his familiars
attend him still, deceived by the lying appearance of life; and his
power, though now an empty fraud, is still dark and awful upon
Poseidonis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, following the slow-measured words of Maranapion, there was
silence in the vault. A dark, furtive triumph smoldered in the face of
Gadeiron, on whom the yoke of Malygris had lain heavily, irking his
pride. Among the twelve sorcerers, there was none who wished well to
Malygris, nor any who did not fear him; and they received the
annunciation of his demise with dreadful, half-incredulous joy. Some
there were who doubted, holding that Maranapion was mistaken; and in
the faces of all, as in somber mirrors, their awe of the master was
still reflected.</p>

<p>Maranapion, who had hated Malygris above all others, as the one
warlock whose art and power excelled his own, stood aloof and
inscrutable like a poising vulture.</p>

<p>It was King Gadeiron who broke the gravid silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not idly have I called ye to this crypt, O sorcerers of Susran:
for a work remains to be done. Verily, shall the corpse of a dead
necromancer tyrannize over us all? There is mystery here, and a need
to move cautiously, for the duration of his necromancy is yet
unverified and untested. But I have called ye together in order that
the hardiest among ye may take council with Maranapion, and aid him in
devising such wizardry as will now expose the fraud of Malygris, and
evince his mortality to all men, as well as to the fiends that follow
him still, and the ministering monsters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A babble of disputation rose, and they who were most doubtful of
this matter, and feared to work against Malygris in any fashion,
begged Gadeiron's leave to withdraw. In the end, there remained seven
of the twelve&hellip;.</p>

<p>Swiftly, by dim and covert channels, on the day that followed, the
death of Malygris was bruited throughout the isle Poseidonis. Many
disbelieved the story, for the might of the wizard was a thing seared
as with hot iron on the souls of them that had witnessed his
thaumaturgies. However, it was recalled that during the past year few
had beheld him face to face; and always he had seemed to ignore them,
speaking not, and staring fixedly through the tower window, as if
intent on far things that were veiled to others. During that time, he
had called no man to his presence, and had sent forth no message, no
oracle or decree; and they who had gone before him were mainly bearers
of tribute and had followed a long-established custom.</p>

<p>When these matters became generally known, there were some who
maintained that he sat thus in a long swoon of ecstasy or catalepsy,
and would awaken therefrom in time. Others, however, held that he had
died, and was able to preserve the deceitful aspect of life through a
spell that endured after him. No man dared to enter the tall, sable
tower; and still the shadow of the tower fell athwart Susran like the
shadow of an evil gnomon moving on some disastrous dial; and still the
umbrage of the power of Malygris lay stagnant as the tomb's night on
the minds of men.</p>

<p>Now, among the five sorcerers who had begged Gadeiron's leave to
depart, fearing to join their fellows in the making of wizardry
against Malygris, there were two that plucked heart a little
afterward, when they heard from other sources a confirmation of the
vision beheld by Maranapion through the Cyclop's eye.</p>

<p>These two were brothers, named Nygon and Fustules. Feeling a
certain shame for their timidity, and desiring to rehabilitate
themselves in the regard of the others, they conceived an audacious
plan.</p>

<p>When night had again fallen upon the city, bringing no moon, but
only obscure stars and the scud of sea-born clouds, Nygon and Fustules
went forth through the darkened ways and came to the steep hill at the
heart of Susran, whereon, in half-immemorial years, Malygris had
established his grim citadel.</p>

<aside class="pull-quote-right">
  <blockquote class="pull-quote">
    The wood, it seemed, was full of execrably sighing voices, and
    weird whimpers and little moanings as of imp-children astray from
    Satanic dams.
  </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>The hill was wooded with close-grown cypresses, whose foliage, even
to the full sun, was black and sombre as if tarnished by wizard
fumes. Crouching on either hand, they leaned like misshapen spirits of
the night above the stairs of adamant that gave access to the
tower. Nygon and Fustules, mounting the stairs, cowered and trembled
when the boughs swung menacingly toward them in violent gusts of
wind. They felt the dripping of heavy sea-dews, blown in their faces
like a spittle of demons. The wood, it seemed, was full of execrably
sighing voices, and weird whimpers and little moanings as of
imp-children astray from Satanic dams.</p>

<p>The lights of the tower burned through the waving boughs, and
seemed to recede unapproachably as they climbed. More than once the
two regretted their temerity, but at length, without suffering
palpable harm or hindrance, they neared the portals, which stood
eternally open, pouring the effulgence of still, unflaring lamps on
the windy darkness.</p>

<p>Though the plan they had conceived was nefarious, they deemed it
best to enter boldly. The purpose of their visit if any should
challenge or interrogate them was the asking of an oracle from
Malygris, who was famed throughout the isle as the most infallible of
soothsayers.</p>

<p>Freshening momentarily from the sea beyond Susran, the wind
clamored about the tower like an army of devils in flight from deep to
deep, and the long mantles of the sorcerers were blown in their
faces. But, entering the wide portals, they heard no longer the crying
of the gale, and felt no more its pursuing rudeness. At a single step
they passed into mausolean silence. Around them the lamplight fell
unshaken on caryatids of black marble, on mosaics of precious gems, on
fabulous metals and many-storied tapestries; and a tideless perfume
weighed upon the air like a balsam of death. They felt an involuntary
awe, deeming the mortal stillness a thing that was hardly
natural. But, seeing that the tower vestibule was unguarded by any of
the creatures of Malygris, they were emboldened to go on and climb the
marmorean stairs to the apartments above.</p>

<p>Everywhere, by the light of opulent lamps, they beheld inestimable
and miraculous treasures. There were tables of ebony wrought with
sorcerous runes of pearl and white coral; webs of silver and samite,
cunningly pictured; caskets of electrum overflowing with talismanic
jewels; tiny gods of jade and agate; and tall chryselephantine
demons. Here was the loot of ages, lying heaped and mingled in utter
negligence, without lock or ward, as if free for any casual thief.</p>

<p>Eyeing the riches about them with covetous wonder, the two
sorcerers mounted slowly from room to room, unchallenged and
unmolested, and came ultimately to that upper hall in which Malygris
was wont to receive his visitors.</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, the portals stood open before them, and lamps
burned as if in a trance of light. The lust of plunder was hot in
their hearts. Made bolder still by the seeming desolation, and
thinking now that the tower was uninhabited by any but the dead
magician, they went in with little hesitancy.</p>

<p>Like the rooms below, the chamber was full of precious artifacts;
and iron-bound volumes and brazen books of occult, tremendous
necromancy, together with golden and earthen censers, and vials of
unshatterable crystal, were strewn in weird confusion about the mosaic
floor. At the very center there sat the old archimage in his chair of
primeval ivory, peering with stark, immovable eyes at the night-black
window.</p>

<p>Nygon and Fustules felt their awe return upon them, remembering too
clearly now the thrice-baleful mastery that this man had wielded, and
the demon lore he had known, and the spells he had wrought that were
irrefragable by other wizards. The specters of these things rose up
before them as if by a final necromancy. With down-dropped eyes and
humble mien, they went forward, bowing reverentially. Then, speaking
aloud, in accordance with their predetermined plan, Fustules requested
an oracle of their fortunes from Malygris.</p>

<p>There was no answer, and lifting their eyes, the brothers were
greatly reassured by the aspect of the seated ancient. Death alone
could have set the grayish pallor on the brow, could have locked the
lips in a rigor as of fast-frozen clay. The eyes were like
cavern-shadowed ice, holding no other light than a vague reflection of
the lamps. Under the beard that was half silver, half sable, the
cheeks had already fallen in as with beginning decay, showing the
harsh outlines of the skull. The gray and hideously shrunken hands,
whereon the eyes of enchanted beryls and rubies burned, were clenched
inflexibly on the chair-arms which had the form of arching
basilisks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; murmured Nygon, &ldquo;there is naught here
to frighten or dismay us. Behold, it is only the lich of an old man
after all, and one that has cheated the worm of his due provender
overlong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Fustules. &ldquo;But this man, in his time,
was the greatest of all necromancers. Even the ring on his little
finger is a sovereign talisman. The balas-ruby of the thumbring of his
right hand will conjure demons from out of the deep. In the volumes
that lie about the chamber, there are secrets of perished gods and the
mysteries of planets immemorial. In the vials, there are sirups that
give strange visions, and philtres that can revive the dead. Among
these things, it is ours to choose freely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nygon, eyeing the gems greedily, selected a ring that encircled the
right forefinger with the sixfold coils of a serpent of orichalchum,
bearing in its mouth a beryl shaped like a griffin's egg. Vainly,
however, he tried to loosen the finger from its rigid clutch on the
chair-arm, to permit the removal of the ring. Muttering impatiently,
he drew a knife from his girdle and prepared to hew away the
finger. In the meanwhile, Fustules had drawn his own knife as a
preliminary before approaching the other hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is thy heart firm within thee, brother?&rdquo; he inquired
in a sort of sibilant whisper. &ldquo;If so, there is even more to be
gained than these talismanic rings. It is well known that a wizard who
attains to such supremacy as Malygris, undergoes by virtue thereof a
complete bodily transformation, turning his flesh into elements more
subtle than those of common flesh. And whoso eats of his flesh even so
much as a tiny morsel will share thereafter in the powers owned by the
wizard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nygon nodded as he bent above the chosen finger. &ldquo;This, too,
was in my thought,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>Before he or Fustules could begin their ghoulish attack, they were
startled by a venomous hissing that appeared to emanate from the bosom
of Malygris. They drew back in amazement and consternation, while a
small coral viper slid from behind the necromancer's beard, and glided
swiftly over his knees to the floor like a sinuous rill of
scarlet. There, coiling as if to strike, it regarded the thieves with
eyes that were cold and malignant as drops of frozen poison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the black thorns of Taaran!&rdquo; cried
FustuIes. &ldquo;It is one of Malygris' familiars. I have heard of
this viper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning, the two would have fled from the room. But, even as they
turned, the walls and portals seemed to recede before them, fleeing
giddily and interminably, as if unknown gulfs had been admitted to the
chamber. A vertigo seized them; reeling, they saw the little segments
of mosaic under their feet assume the proportions of mighty
flags. Around them the strewn books and censers and vials loomed
enormous, rearing above their heads and barring their way as they
ran.</p>

<p>Nygon, looking over his shoulder, saw that the viper had turned to
a vast python, whose crimson coils were undulating swiftly along the
floor. In a colossal chair, beneath lamps that were large as suns,
there sat the colossal form of the dead archimage, in whose presence
Nygon and Fustules were no more than pigmies. The lips of Malygris
were still immobile beneath his beard; and his eyes still glared
implacably upon the blackness of the far window. But at that instant a
voice filled the awful spaces of the room, reverberating like thunder
in the heavens, hollow and tremendous:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fools! ye have dared to ask me for an oracle. And the oracle
is &mdash; death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nygon and Fustules, knowing their doom, fled on in a madness of
terror and desperation. Beyond the towering thuribles, the tomes that
were piled like pyramids, they saw the threshold in intermittent
glimpses, like a remote horizon. It withdrew before them, dim and
unattainable. They panted as runners pant in a dream. Behind them, the
vermilion python crawled; and overtaking them as they tried to round
the brazen back of a wizard volume, it struck them down like fleeing
dormice&hellip;.</p>

<p>In the end, there was only a small coral viper, that crept back to
its hiding-place in the bosom of Malygris&hellip;</p>

<p>Toiling by day and night, in the vaults under the palace of
Gadeiron, with impious charms and unholy conjurations, and fouler
chemistries, Maranapion and his seven coadjutors had nearly completed
the making of their sorcery.</p>

<p>They designed an invultuation against Malygris that would break the
power of the dead necromancer by rendering evident to all the mere
fact of his death. Employing an unlawful Atlantean science, Maranapion
had created living plasm with all the attributes of human flesh, and
had caused it to grow and flourish, fed with blood. Then he and his
assistants, uniting their wills and convoking the forces that were
blasphemy to summon, had compelled the shapeless, palpitating mass to
put forth the limbs and members of a new-born child; and had formed it
ultimately, after all the changes that man would undergo between birth
and senescence, into an image of Malygris.</p>

<p>Now, carrying the process even further, they caused the simulacrum
to die of extreme age, as Malygris had apparently died. It sat before
them in a chair, facing toward the east, and duplicating the very
posture of the magician on his seat of ivory.</p>

<p>Nothing remained to be done. Forspent and weary, but hopeful, the
sorcerers waited for the first signs of mortal decay in the image. If
the spells they had woven were successful, a simultaneous decay would
occur in the body of Malygris, incorruptible heretofore. Inch by inch,
member by member, he would rot in the adamantine tower; His familiars
would desert him, no longer deceived; and all who came to the tower
would know his mortality; and the tyranny of Malygris would lift from
Susran, and his necromancy be null and void as a broken pentacle in
sea-girt Poseidonis.</p>

<p>For the first time since the beginning of their invultuation, the
eight magicians were free to intermit their vigilance without peril of
invalidating the charm. They slept soundly, feeling that their repose
was well earned. On the morrow they returned, accompanied by King
Gadeiron, to the vault in which they had left the plasmic image.</p>

<p>Opening the sealed door, they were met by a charnel odor, and were
gratified to perceive in the figure the unmistakable signs of
decomposition. A little later, by consulting the Cyclops' eye,
Maranapion verified the paralleling of these marks in the features of
Malygris.</p>

<p>A great jubilation, not unmingled with relief, was felt by the
sorcerers and by King Gadeiron. Heretofore, not knowing the extent and
duration of the powers wielded by the dead master, they had been
doubtful of the efficacy of their own magic. But now, it seemed, there
was no longer any reason for doubt.</p>

<p>On that very day it happened that certain seafaring merchants went
before Malygris to pay him, according to custom, a share of the
profits of their latest voyage. Even as they bowed in the presence of
the master, they became aware, by sundry disagreeable tokens, that
they had borne tribute to a corpse. Not daring even then to refuse the
long-exacted toll, they flung it down and fled from the place in
terror.</p>

<p>Soon, in all Susran, there was none who doubted any longer the
death of Malygris. And yet, such was the awe he had wrought through
many lustrums, that few were venturous enough to invade the tower; and
thieves were wary, and would not try to despoil its fabled
treasures.</p>

<p>Day by day, in the blue, monstrous eye of the Cyclops, Maranapion
saw the rotting of his dreaded rival. And upon him presently there
came a strong desire to visit the tower and behold face to face that
which he had witnessed only in vision. Thus alone would his triumph be
complete.</p>

<p>So it was that he and the sorcerers who had aided him, together
with King Gadeiron, went up to the sable tower by the steps of
adamant, and climbed by the marble stairs, even as Nygon and Fustules
before them, to the high room in which Malygris was seated... But the
doom of Nygon and Fustules, being without other witnesses than the
dead, was wholly unknown to them.</p>

<p>Boldly and with no hesitation they entered the chamber. Slanting
through the western window, the sun of late afternoon fell goldenly on
the dust that had gathered everywhere. Spiders had woven their webs on
the bright-jeweled censers, on the graven lamps, and the metal-covered
volumes of sorcery. The air was stagnant with a stifling foulness of
death.</p>

<p>The intruders went forward, feeling that impulse which leads the
victors to exult over a vanquished enemy. Malygris sat unbowed and
upright, his black and tattered fingers clutching the ivory chair-arms
as of yore, and his empty orbits glowering still at the eastern
window. His face was little more than a bearded skull; and his
blackening brow was like worm-pierced ebony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Malygris, I give thee greeting,&rdquo; said Maranapion in
a loud voice of mockery. &ldquo;Grant, I beseech thee, a sign, if thy
wizardry still prevails, and hath not become the appanage of
oblivion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greeting, O Maranapion,&rdquo; replied a grave and terrible
voice that issued from the maggot-eaten lips. &ldquo;Indeed, I will
grant thee a sign. Even as I, in death, have rotted upon my seat from
the foul sorcery which was wrought in the vaults of King Gadeiron, so
thou and thy fellows and Gadeiron, living, shall decay and putrefy
wholly in an hour, by virtue of the curse that I put upon ye
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the shrunken corpse of Malygris, fulminating the runes of an
old Atlantean formula, cursed the eight sorcerers and King
Gadeiron. The formula, at frequent intervals, was cadenced with fatal
names of lethal gods; and in it were told the secret appellations of
the black god of time, and the Nothingness that abides beyond time;
and use was made of the titles of many tomb-lairing demons. Heavy and
hollow-sounding were the runes, and in them one seemed to hear a noise
of great blows on sepulchral doors, and a clangor of downfallen
slabs. The air darkened as if with the hovering of seasonless night,
and thereupon, like a breathing of the night, a chillness entered the
chamber; and it seemed that the black wings of ages passed over the
tower, beating prodigiously from void to void, ere the curse was
done.</p>

<p>Hearing that maranatha, the sorcerers were dumb with the extremity
of their dread; and even Maranapion could recall no counter-spell
effectual in any degree against it. All would have fled from the room
ere the curse ended, but a mortal weakness was upon them, and they
felt a sickness as of quick-coming death. Shadows were woven athwart
their eyes; but through the shadows, each beheld dimly the instant
blackening of the faces of his fellows, and saw the cheeks fall
ruinously, and the lips curl back on the teeth like those of long-dead
cadavers.</p>

<p>Trying to run, each was aware of his own limbs that rotted beneath
him, pace by pace, and felt the quick sloughing of his flesh in
corruption from the bone. Crying out with tongues that shriveled ere
the cry was done, they fell down on the floor of the chamber. Life
lingered in them, together with the dire knowledge of their doom, and
they preserved something of hearing and sight. In the dark agony of
their live corruption, they tossed feebly to and fro, and crawled
inchmeal on the chill mosaic. And they still moved in this fashion,
slowly and more imperceptibly, till their brains were turned to gray
mold, and the sinews were parted from their bones, and the marrow was
dried up.</p>

<p>Thus, in an hour, the curse was accomplished. The enemies of the
necromancer lay before him, supine and shrunken, in the tomb's final
posture, as if doing obeisance to a seated Death. Except for the
garments, none could have told King Gadeiron from Maranapion, nor
Maranapion from the lesser wizards.</p>
