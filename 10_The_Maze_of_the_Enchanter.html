<h1>The Maze of the Enchanter</h1>
<h2>Clark Ashton Smith</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>With no other light than that of the four diminutive moons of
Xiccarph, each in a different phase but all decrescent, Tiglari had
crossed the bottomless swamp of Soorm, wherein no reptile dwelt and no
dragon descended &mdash; but where the pitch-black ooze was alive with
continual heavings and writhings. He had carefully avoided the high
causey of white corundum that spanned the fen, and had threaded his
way with infinite peril from isle to sedgy isle that shuddered
gelatinously beneath him. When he reached the solid shore and the
shelter of the palm-tall rushes, he was equally careful to avoid the
pale porphyry stairs that wound heavenward through dizzy,
nadir-cleaving chasms and along glassy scarps to the ever-mysterious
and terrible house of Maal Dweb. The causey and the stairs were
guarded by those that he did not wish to meet: the silent, colossal
iron servitors of Maal Dweb, whose arms ended in long crescent blades
of tempered steel which were raised in implacable scything against any
who came thither without their master's permission.</p>

<p>Tiglari's naked body was smeared from crown to heel with the juice
of a jungle plant repugnant to all the fauna of Xiccarph. By virtue of
this he hoped to pass unharmed the ferocious ape-like creatures that
roamed at will through the cliff-hung gardens and halls of the
Tyrant. He carried a coil of woven root-fiber, wonderfully strong and
light, and weighted with a brazen ball at one end, for use in climbing
the mountain. At his side, in a sheath of chimera-skin, he wore a
needle-sharp knife that had been dipt in the mortal poison of winged
vipers.</p>

<p>Many, before Tiglari, with the same noble dream of tyrannicide, had
attempted to cross the pitchy fen and scale the forbidding scarps. But
none had returned; and the fate of such as had actually won to the
mountain palace of Maal Dweb was a much-disputed problem; since no man
had ever again beheld them, living or dead. But Tiglari, the jungle
hunter, skilled in the slaying of fierce and crafty beasts, was
undeterred by the more than hideous probabilities before him.</p>

<p>The escalade of the mountain would have been a highly dangerous
feat by the full light of the three suns of Xiccarph. With eyes that
were keen as those of some night-flying pterodactyl, Tiglari hurled
his weighted coil about projecting coigns and fang-like salients. Hand
over hand, he went up with simian ease from foothold to precarious
foothold; and at length he attained a narrow buttress beneath the
final cliff. From this vantage, it was an easy matter to fling his
rope around the crooked bole of a tree that leaned gulfward with
scimitar-like foliage from the gardens of Maal Dweb.</p>

<p>Evading the sharp and semi-metallic leaves that seemed to slash
downward as the tree bent limberly with his dangling weight, he stood,
stooping warily, on the fearsome and widely fabled mesa. Here, it was
rumored, with no human aid, the half-demoniac sorcerer and scientist
had carved the more lofty pinnacles of the old mountain into walls,
cupolas and turrets, and had levelled a great space about them. This
space he had covered immediately with loamy soil, produced by magic;
and therein he had planted curious baneful trees from outlying worlds
beyond the suns of Xiccarph, together with flowers that might have
been those of some teeming and exuberant hell.</p>

<p>Little enough was actually known of these gardens; but the flora
that grew on the northern, southern and western sides of the palace
was popularly believed to be less deadly than that which faced the
dawning of the triple suns. Much of this latter vegetation, according
to myth, had been trained and topiarized in the form of an almost
infinite labyrinth, balefully ingenious, from which egress was
impossible: a maze that concealed in its windings the most fatal and
atrocious traps, the most unpredictable dooms, invented by the malign
Daedalus. Mindful of this labyrinth, Tiglari had approached the place
on the side that fronted the three-fold sunset.</p>

<p>Breathless, with arms that ached from the long, arduous climb, he
crouched in the garden shadows. About him he saw the heavy-hooded
blossoms that leaned from a winy gloom in venomous languour, or fawned
toward him with open corollas that exhaled a narcotic perfume or
diffused a pollen of madness. Anomalous, multiform, with silhouettes
that curdled the blood or touched the brain with nightmare, the trees
of Maal Dweb appeared to gather and conspire against him beyond the
flowers. Some arose with the sinuous towering of plumed pythons, or
aigretted dragons. Others crouched with radiating limbs that were like
the hairy members of colossal arachnidans. They seemed to close in
upon Tiglari with a stealthy motion. They waved their frightful darts
of thorn, their scythe-like leaves. They blotted the four moons with
webs of arabesque menace. They reared from interminably coiling roots
behind mammoth foliages that resembled an army of interlocking
shields.</p>

<p>With endless caution and calculation, the hunter made his way
forward, seeking a rift in the armed phalanx of vegetable
monstrosities. His faculties, ever alert, were abnormally quickened by
a grievous fear, intensified by a mighty hatred. The fear was not for
himself, but for the girl Athl&eacute;, his beloved and the fairest of
his tribe, who had gone up alone that very evening by the causey of
corundum and the porphyry stairs at the summons of Maal Dweb. His
hatred was that of a brave man and an outraged lover for the
all-powerful, all-dreaded tyrant whom no man had ever seen, and from
whose abode no woman came back; who spoke with an iron voice that was
audible at will in the far cities or the outmost jungles; who punished
the rebellious and the disobedient with a doom of falling fire that
was swifter than the thunderstone.</p>

<p>Maal Dweb had taken ever the fairest from among the maidens of the
planet Xiccarph; and no palace of walled towns, or savage outland
cave, was exempt from his unknown scrutiny. He had chosen no less than
fifty girls during the three decades of his tyranny; and these,
forsaking their lovers and kinsfolk voluntarily, lest the wrath of
Maal Dweb should descend upon them, had gone one by one to the
mountain citadel and were lost behind its cryptic walls. There, as the
odalisques of the aging sorcerer, they were supposed to dwell in halls
that multiplied their beauty with a thousand mirrors; and were said to
have for servants women of brass and men of iron that mimicked in all
ways the motion and speech of living people.</p>

<p>Tiglari had poured before Athl&eacute; the uncouth adoration of his
heart and the barbaric spoils of the chase, but having many rivals,
was still unsure of her favor. Cool as a river lily, and no less
impartial, she had accepted his worship and that of the others, among
whom the warrior Mocair was perhaps the most formidable. Returning at
eve from the hunt, Tiglari had found the tribe in lamentation; and,
learning that Athl&eacute; had departed to the harem of Maal Dweb, was
swift to follow.</p>

<p>He had not announced his intention to his fellow tribesmen, since
the ears of Maal Dweb were everywhere; and he did not know whether
Mocair or any of the others had preceded him in his desperate
errantry. Mocair, however, had been absent; and it was not unlikely
that he had already dared the obscure and hideous perils of the
mountain.</p>

<p>The thought of this was enough to drive Tiglari forward with a rash
disregard of the poisonous, reptile flowers and clutching
foliations. He came anon to a gap in the horrible grove, and saw the
saffron lights from the lower windows of Maal Dweb, and a dark
thronging of domes and turrets that assailed the constellations
above. The lights were vigilant as the eyes of sleepless dragons, and
appeared to regard him with an evil, unblinking awareness. But Tiglari
leapt toward them, across the gap, and heard the clash of sabered
leaves that met behind him.</p>

<p>Before him was an open lawn, covered with a queer grass that
squirmed like innumerable worms beneath his bare feet. He did not care
to linger upon that lawn, but ran onward with light, skimming
paces. There were no footmarks in the grass; but nearing the portico
of the palace, he saw a coil of thin rope that someone had flung
aside, and knew that Mocair had preceded him.</p>

<p>There were paths of mottled marble about the palace, and fountains
and waterfalls that played with a gurgling as of blood from the
throats of carven monsters. The open portals were unguarded, and the
whole building was still as a mausoleum lit by windless lamps. No
shadows moved behind the brilliant yellow windows; and darkness slept
unbroken among the high towers and cupolas. Tiglari, however,
mistrusted sorely the appearance of quietude and slumber, and followed
the bordering paths for some distance before daring to approach nearer
to the palace.</p>

<p>Certain large and shadowy animals, which he took for the apish
monsters of Maal Dweb, went by him in the gloom. They were hairy and
uncouth, with sloping heads. Some of them ran in four-footed fashion,
while others maintained the half-erect posture of anthropoids. They
did not offer to molest Tiglari: but, whining dismally like dogs, they
slunk away as if to avoid him. By this token, he knew that they were
veritable beasts, and could not abide the odor with which he had
smeared his limbs and torso.</p>

<p>At length, he came to a lampless portico with crowded
columns. Here, with the silent gliding of a jungle snake, he entered
the mysterious and ever-dreadful house of Maal Dweb. Behind the dark
pillars, a door stood open; and beyond the door were the dim and
seemingly endless reaches of an empty hall.</p>

<p>Tiglari went in with redoubled caution, and began to follow the
arrased wall. The place was full of unknown perfumes, languorous and
somnolent: a subtle reek as of censers in hidden alcoves of love. He
did not like the perfumes; and the silence troubled him more and more
as he went deeper into the palace. It seemed to him that the darkness
was thick with unheard breathings, was alive with invisible and
sinister movements.</p>

<p>Slowly, like the opening of great yellow eyes, the yellow flames
arose in mighty lamps of copper that hung along the hall. Tiglari hid
himself behind a heavy-figured arras; but peeping out with eerie
trepidation, he saw that the hall was still deserted. Finally, he
dared to resume his progress. All about him, the imperial hangings,
broidered with purple men and azure women on a field of bright blood,
appeared to stir with easy life in a wind that he could not feel; and
the lamps regarded him with unwavering splendid eyes. But there was no
sign of the presence of Maal Dweb; and the metal servitors and human
odalisques of the tyrant were nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>The doors on either side of the hall, with cunningly mated valves
of ebony and ivory, were all closed. At the far end, Tiglari saw a
rift of flaming light in a somber double arras. Parting the arras very
softly, he peered into a huge, brightly illumined chamber that seemed
at first sight to be the harem of Maal Dweb, peopled with all the
girls that the enchanter had summoned to his mountain dwelling over a
course of decades. In fact, it seemed that there were many hundreds,
leaning or recumbent on ornate couches, or standing in attitudes of
languor or terror. Tiglari discerned in the throng the women of
Ommu-Zain, whose flesh is whiter than desert salt; the slim girls of
Uthmai, who are moulded from breathing, palpitating jet; the queenly
amber girls of equatorial Xala; and the small women of Ilap, who have
the tones of newly greening bronze. But among them all, he could not
find the lilied beauty of Athl&eacute;.</p>

<p>Greatly did he marvel at the number of the women and the utter
stillness with which they maintained their various postures. There was
no lifting nor falling of eyelids, no dropping of hands, no curving
nor opening of lips. They were like images of living, subtly painted
marble, or goddesses that slept in some enchanted hall of
eternity.</p>

<p>Tiglari, the intrepid hunter, was awed and frightened. Here,
surely, was proof of the fabled sorceries of Maal Dweb. These women -
if indeed they were women and not mere statues &mdash; had been made
the thralls of a death-like spell of immortal slumber. It was as if
some invisible medium of adamantine silence had filled the room, had
formed about its occupants: a silence wherein, it seemed, no mortal
being could draw breath.</p>

<p>However, if Tiglari were to continue his search for Maal Dweb and
Athl&eacute;, it was necessary for him to traverse the enchanted
chamber. Feeling that a marble sleep might descend upon him at the
very crossing of the sill, he went with holden breath and furtive
pard-like paces. About him, the women preserved their eternal
stillness, their various airs and attitudes. Each, it appeared, had
been overcome by the spell at the instant of some particular emotion,
whether of fear, wonder, curiosity, vanity, weariness, anger or
voluptuousness. Their number was fewer than he had supposed, and the
room itself was smaller, but metal mirrors, panelling the walls, had
created an illusion of multitude and immensity.</p>

<p>At the further end, he came to a second double arras, slightly
parted, and revealing only shadow beyond. Peering through, he beheld a
twilight chamber, illuminated dimly by two censers that gave forth a
parti-colored glow and a red fume as of vaporing blood. The censers
were set on lofty tripods in the far corners, facing each
other. Between them, beneath a canopy of some dark and smouldering
stuff with fringes braided like women's hair, was a couch of nocturnal
purples with a valance of silver birds that fought against golden
snakes. On the couch, in sober garments, a man reclined as if weary or
asleep. The face of the man was a pale mask of mystery lying amid
ambiguous shadows; but it did not occur to Tiglari that this being was
any other than the redoubtable and tyrannic sorcerer whom he had come
to slay. He knew that this was Maal Dweb, whom no man had seen in the
flesh, but whose power was manifest to all; the occult, omniscient
ruler of Xiccarph; the overlord of kings; the suzerain of the three
suns and of all their moons and planets.</p>

<p>Like ghostly sentinels, the symbols of the grandeur of Maal Dweb,
the images of his frightful empire, rose up to confront Tiglari. But
the thought of Athl&eacute; was a red mist that blotted all. He forgot
his eerie terrors, his awe of the ensorcelled palace. The rage of the
bereaved lover, the bloodthirst of the cunning hunter, awoke within
him to guide his agile, stealthy paces, to make firm his powerful
thews. The chamber was empty, except for the still and languid figure
on the couch. Tiglari neared the unconscious sorcerer; and his hand
grew tight on the hilt of the needle-like knife that was dipt in
viper-venom.</p>

<p>The man before him lay with closed eyes and a cryptic weariness on
his mouth and eyelids. He seemed to meditate rather than sleep, like
one who wanders in a maze of distant memories or profound
reveries. About him the walls were draped with funereal hangings,
darkly and vaguely figured. Above him the twin censers wrought a
cloudy glow, and diffused throughout the room their drowsy myrrh,
which made the senses of Tiglari swim with a strange dimness.</p>

<p>Crouching tiger-wise beside the valance of birds and serpents, he
made ready for the stroke. Then, mastering the subtle vertigo of the
perfumes, he rose up; and his arm, with the darting movement of some
heavy but supple adder, struck fiercely at the tyrant's heart.</p>

<p>It was as if he had tried to pierce a wall of adamant. In mid-air,
before and above the recumbent enchanter, the knife clashed on some
impenetrable substance that Tiglari could not see; and the point broke
off and tinkled on the floor at his feet. Uncomprehending, baffled, he
peered at the being whom he had sought to slay. Maal Dweb had not
stirred nor opened his eyes. There was neither frown nor smile on his
features; but their look of enigmatic weariness was somehow touched
with a faint and cruel amusement.</p>

<p>Hesitantly, Tiglari put out his hand to verify a certain curious
notion that had occurred to him. Even as he had suspected, there was
no couch or canopy between the fuming censers &mdash; only a vertical,
unbroken, highly-polished surface, in which the whole scene was
apparently reflected. He had tried to kill a mirrored image. But, to
his further mystification, he himself was not visible in the
mirror.</p>

<p>He whirled about, thinking Maal Dweb must be somewhere in the
room. Even as he turned, the funereal draperies rushed back with an
evil, silken whispering from the wall, as if drawn by unseen
hands. The chamber leaped into sudden glaring light, the walls
appeared to recede illimitably; and naked giants, whose umber-brown
limbs and torsos glistened as if smeared with ointment, stood in
menacing postures on every side. Their eyes glowered like those of
jungle creatures; and each of them held an enormous knife, from which
the point had been broken.</p>

<p>This, thought Tiglari, was a fearsome thaumaturgy; and he crouched
down beneath the tripods, wary as a trapped animal, to await the
assault of the giants. But these beings, crouching simultaneously,
mimicked his every movement. By degrees it came to him that what he
saw was his own reflection, multiplied and monstrously amplified in
the mirrors of Maal Dweb.</p>

<p>He turned again. The tasseled canopy, the couch of night-dark
purples with its figured valance, the reclining dreamer in plain
vestments, all had vanished. Of that which he had beheld, only the
smoking censers remained, rearing before a glassy wall that gave back
like the others the reflection of Tiglari himself.</p>

<p>Bafflement and terror united now in the savage brain of the
hunter. He felt that Maal Dweb, the all-seeing, all-potent magician,
was playing a game and was deluding him with elaborate
mockeries. Rashly indeed had Tiglari pitted his simple brawn and
forest craft against a being of such supernatural power and demoniac
artifice. He dared not stir; he scarcely ventured to breathe. The
monstrous reflections appeared to watch him like ogres who guard a
captive pygmy. The light, which emanated as if from hidden lamps in
the mirrors, took on a more pitiless and alarming luster, and centered
itself upon him with a silent horror. The vast, illusive reaches of
the room appeared to deepen; and far away in their shadows, he saw the
gathering of vapors with human faces that melted and re-formed
incessantly and were never twice the same.</p>

<p>Ever the eerie radiance brightened; ever the mist of faces, like a
hell-born fume, dissolved and re-limned itself behind the immobile
giants, in the lengthening vistas. An unheard laughter, malevolent,
scornful, seemed to lurk beyond the stillness. How long Tiglari
waited, he could not tell; the bright and frozen horror of that room
was a thing apart from time.</p>

<p>Now, in the litten air, a voice began to speak; a voice that was
toneless, deliberate &mdash; and disembodied. It was faintly
contemptuous; a little weary; slightly cruel. It was impossible to
align or locate; near as the beating of Tiglari's heart, and yet
infinitely far.</p>

<p><q>What do you seek, Tiglari?</q> said the voice. <q>Do you think
to enter with impunity the palace of Maal Dweb? Others &mdash; many
others, with the same intentions &mdash; have come before you: but all
have paid a certain price for their temerity.</q></p>

<p><q>I seek the maiden Athl&eacute;,</q> said Tiglari. <q>What have
you done with her?</q> The words were strange to him, their very sound
was remote, as if another than himself had spoken.</p>

<p><q>Athl&eacute; is very beautiful,</q> replied the voice. <q>It is
the will of Maal Dweb to make a certain use of her loveliness. The use
is not one that should concern a hunter of wild beasts &hellip; You
are unwise, Tiglari.</q>

<q>Where is Athl&eacute;?</q> persisted the hunter.</p>

<p><q>Athl&eacute; has gone to find her fate in the labyrinth of Maal
Dweb. Not long ago, the warrior Mocair, who had followed her to my
palace, went out at my suggestion to pursue his search amid the
threadless windings of that never to be exhausted maze. Go now,
Tiglari, and seek her also &hellip; There are many mysteries in my
labyrinth; and among them all, mayhap, there is one which you are
destined to solve.</q></p>

<p>The hunter saw that a door had opened in the mirror-panelled
wall. In the depth of the mirrors, two of the metal slaves of Maal
Dweb had appeared. Taller than living men, and gleaming from head to
foot with implacable lusters as of burnished swords, they came forward
upon Tiglari. The right arm of each was handed with a crescent
sickle. Hastily, with no backward glance, the hunter went out through
the open door. Behind him he heard the surly clash of its meeting
valves.</p>

<p>The short night of the planet Xiccarph was not yet over; and the
four moons had all gone down. But before him he saw the beginning of
the fabled maze, illuminated clearly by glowing globular fruits that
hung lantern-wise from baroque arches and arcades of foliage. Guided
by their still, uncanny luminescence, he entered the labyrinth.</p>

<p>At first, it was a place of elfin fantasies and whims. There were
quaintly turned estrades, pillared with slim and antic trees, latticed
with the drolly peering faces of extravagant orchids, that led the
seeker to hidden, surprising bowers of goblinry. It was as if those
outer meanderings had been planned merely to entice and bemuse and
beguile.</p>

<p>Then, by vague degrees, as the hunter went on, it seemed that the
designer's mood had darkened, had become more ominous and baleful. The
trees that lined the path, with twisted, intertwining boles, were
Laocoons of struggle and torture, lit by enormous fungi that seemed to
lift unholy tapers. The path itself ran downward, or climbed with
evilly tilted steps through caverns of imbricated leafage that shone
with the brazen glistening of dragon-scales. At every turning the way
divided before Tiglari; the devious branchings multiplied; and
skillful though he was in jungle-craft, it would have been wholly
impossible for him to retrace his wanderings. He kept on, hoping that
chance would somehow lead him to Athl&eacute;; and many times he
called her name aloud, but was answered only by remote, derisive
echoes, or by the dolorous howling of some unseen beast that had
become lost in the maze of Maal Dweb.</p>

<p>He came to eerie pools, alight with coiling and wreathing
witch-fires, in dim arboreal grottoes. Greenish, bloated hands as of
dead men appeared to lift from the changing films of phosphorescence;
and once he thought that he beheld the drowning face of
Athl&eacute;. He plunged into the shallow pool &mdash; but found only
fetid slime, and a swollen, nauseous thing that squirmed slowly
beneath his touch.</p>

<p>Now he was mounting through arbors of malignant hydra growths that
coiled and uncoiled about him tumultuously. The way lightened more and
more; the night-shining fruits and blossoms were pale and sickly as
the dying tapers of a witches' revel. The earliest of the three suns
had risen; and its gamboge-yellow beams were filtering in through the
plaited horrors of frilled and venomous vines.</p>

<p>Far off, and seeming to fall from some hidden height in the
labyrinth before him, he heard a chorus of brazen voices that were
like articulate bells or gongs. He could not distinguish the words;
but the accents were those of a solemn and portentous
announcement. They were fraught with mystic finality, with hieratic
doom. They ceased; and there was no sound other than the hiss and
rustle of swaying plants.</p>

<p>Tiglari went on. The tortuous maze became wilder and more
anomalous. There were tiered growths, like obscene sculptures or
architectural forms, that seemed to be of stone and metal. Others were
like carnal nightmares of rooted flesh, that wallowed and fought and
coupled in noisome ooze. Foul things with chancrous blossoms flaunted
themselves on infernal obelisks. Living parasitic mosses of crimson
crawled on vegetable monsters that swelled and bloated behind the
columns of accursed pavilions.</p>

<p>It seemed now that the hunter's every step was predestined and
dictated. He was no longer free to choose his way; for many paths were
overgrown by things that he did care to face; and others were blocked
by horrid portcullises of cacti, or ended in pools whose waters teemed
with leeches larger than tunnies. The second and third suns of
Xiccarph arose; but their beams of emerald and carmine served but to
heighten the terrors of the web that had closed in about Tiglari.</p>

<p>By stairs where floral serpents crept, and gradients lined with
tossing, clashing aloes, he climbed slowly on. Rarely could he see the
labyrinthine reaches below, or the levels toward which he was
tending. Somewhere on the blind path, he met one of the ape-like
animals of Maal Dweb: a dark, savage creature, sleek and glistening
like a wet otter, as if it had bathed in one of the hidden pools. It
passed him with a hoarse growl, recoiling as the others had done from
his repulsively smeared body&hellip;. But nowhere could he find the
maiden Athl&eacute; or the warrior Mocair, who had preceded him into
the maze.</p>

<p>Now he had reached a curious little pavement of somber onyx,
oblong, and wholly surrounded, except on the side of his approach, by
enormous flowers with fluted bronze-like stems and great leaning balls
that seemed to be the mottled heads of bestial chimeras, yawning to
disclose their carmine throats. Through the gap in this singular
hedge, he stepped forward on the pavement and stood staring
irresolutely at the serried blooms: for here the way seemed to
end.</p>

<p>The onyx beneath his feet was wet with some unknown, sticky
fluid. He was dazed with the wonder, strangeness, and intricate,
coiling horror through which he had passed; but a dim warning of peril
stirred within him. He turned toward the gap through which he had
entered, but his impulse of retreat was all too late. From the base of
each of the tall flower stems, a long tendril like a wire of bronze
uncoiled with lightning rapidity, and closed about his ankles. He
stood trapped and helpless at the center of a taut net. Then, while he
struggled ineffectually, the huge stems began to lean and tilt toward
him, till the carmine mouths of the blossoms were close about his
knees like a circle of fawning monsters.</p>

<p>Nearer they came, almost touching him. From their thick lips a
clear, hueless liquid, dripping slowly at first, and then running in
little rills, descended on his feet and ankles and
shanks. Indescribably, his flesh crawled beneath it; then there was a
peculiar passing numbness; then a furious stinging like the bites of
innumerable insects. Between the crowding heads of the flowers he saw
that his legs had undergone a mysterious and horrifying change; their
natural hairiness had thickened, had assumed a dark and shaggy pile
like the fur of apes; the shanks themselves had somehow shortened; and
the feet had grown longer, with uncouth finger-like toes such as were
possessed by the animals of Maal Dweb!</p>

<p>In a frenzy of nameless alarm and fear, he drew his broken-tipped
knife and began to slash at the flowers. It was as if he had struck at
monstrous bells of ringing iron, had assailed the armored heads of
dragons. The blade snapped at the hilt. Then the blossoms, lifting
hideously, were leaning about his waist, were laving his hips and
thighs in their thin, evil slaver.</p>

<p>Across the bizarre nightmare in which his brain and body were
drowning impotently, he heard the startled cry of a woman. Through the
open gap in the hedge, he beheld a strange scene which the hitherto
impenetrable maze, parting as if magic, had revealed. Fifty feet away,
on the same level as the onyx pavement, there stood an elliptic dais
or low altar of moonwhite stone at whose center the maiden
Athl&eacute;, emerging from the labyrinth on a raised walk of
porphyry, had paused in an attitude of wonder. Before her, in the
claws of an immense marble lizard that reared above the dais, a great
circular mirror of steely metal was held upright, with the monster's
head hidden from view behind it. Athl&eacute;, as if fascinated by
some celestial vision, was peering into the steely disk. She presented
her wide-eyed profile to Tiglari; and the mirror itself was seen
obliquely, with the foreshortened body of the lizard reaching away at
a sharp angle and mingling obscenely with the half-reptilian
maze. Midway between the onyx pavement and the ellipse of pale stone,
a row of six slender brazen columns, topped with graven heads like
demoniac Termini, rose at broad intervals and faced alternately the
hunter and the girl.</p>

<p>Tiglari would have called out to Athl&eacute;; but at that moment
she took a single step toward the mirror, as if drawn by something
that she saw in its depths; and the dull disk seemed to brighten with
some internal, incandescent flame. The eyes of the hunter were
temporarily blinded by the spiky rays that leapt forth from it for an
instant, enveloping and transfixing the maiden. When the dimness
cleared away in swirling blots of sultry color, he saw that
Athl&eacute;, in a pose of statuesque rigidity, was still regarding
the mirror with startled eyes. She had not moved; the wonder was
frozen on her face: and it came to Tiglari that she was like the women
who slept an enchanted slumber in the palace of Maal Dweb. Even as
this thought occurred to him, he heard the ringing chorus of metallic
voices, that seemed to emanate from the graven demon heads upon the
columns.</p>

<p><q>The maiden Athl&eacute;,</q> announced the voices in solemn and
portentous tones, <q>has beheld herself in the mirror of Eternity, and
has passed forever beyond the changes and corruptions of Time.</q>
Tiglari felt that he was sinking into some enormous, obscurely
terrible fen of dreams. He could comprehend nothing of what had
befallen Athl&eacute;; and his own fate was an equally dark and dread
enigma beyond the solution of a simple hunter.</p>

<p>Now the leaning blossoms had lifted about his shoulders, were
laving his arms, his body. Beneath their abhorrent alchemy the
transformation continued. A long fur sprang up on the thickening
torso; the arms lengthened; they became simian; the hands took on a
likeness to the feet. From the neck downward, Tiglari differed in no
wise from the apes of the garden.</p>

<p>In helpless abject terror, he waited for the completion of the
metamorphosis. Then, slowly, he became aware that a man in sober
garments, with eyes and mouth replete with the weariness of strange
things, was standing before him. Behind the man, as if attending him,
were two of the sickle-handed automatons of iron.</p>

<p>In a somewhat languid voice, the man uttered an unknown word that
vibrated in the air with prolonged, mysterious aftertones. The circle
of craning flowers drew back from Tiglari, resuming their former
upright positions in a weird hedge; and the wiry tendrils were
withdrawn from his ankles, leaving him free. Hardly able to comprehend
his release, he heard a sound of brazen voices, and knew dimly that
the demon heads if the columns had spoken, saying:</p>

<p><q>The hunter Tiglari has been laved in the nectar of the blossoms
of primordial life, and has become in all ways, from the neck
downward, even as the beasts that he hunted.</q></p>

<p>When the solemn chorus ceased, the weary man in sober raiment came
nearer and addressed him:</p>

<p><q>I, Maal Dweb, had intended to deal with you precisely as I dealt
with Mocair and many others. Mocair was the beast that you met in the
labyrinth, with new-made fur that was still sleek and wet from the
liquor of the flowers; and you saw some of his predecessors about the
palace. However, I find that my whims are not always the same. You,
Tiglari, unlike the others, shall at least remain a man from the neck
upward; and you are free to resume your wanderings in the labyrinth,
and escape from it if you can. I do not wish to see you again, and my
clemency arises from another reason than esteem for your kind. Go now:
the maze has many windings which you are yet to traverse.</q>  A
dreadful awe was upon Tiglari; his native fierceness, his savage
volition, were tamed by the enchanter's languid will. With one
backward look of fearful concern and wonder at the frozen shape of
Athl&eacute;, he withdrew obediently, slouching like a great ape. His
fur glistening wetly to the three suns, he vanished amid the
meanderings of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Maal Dweb, attended by his metal slaves, went over to the figure of
Athl&eacute;, which still regarded the steely mirror with astonished
eyes.</p>

<p><q>Mong Lut,</q> he said, addressing by name the nearer of the two
automatons that followed at his heels, <q>it has been, as you know, my
caprice to eternalize the frail beauty of women. Athl&eacute;, like
the others whom I have summoned to the mountain and have sent out to
explore the ingenious maze, has looked upon that mirror whose sudden
radiance turns the flesh to a stone that is fairer than marble and no
less eternal &hellip; Also, as you know, it has been my whim to turn
men into beasts with the copious fluid of certain artificial flowers,
so that their outer semblance should conform strictly to their inner
nature. Is it not well, Mong Lut, that I should have done these
things? Am I not Maal Dweb, in whom all knowledge and all power
reside?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, master,</q> echoed the automaton in an iron voice, <q>you
are Maal Dweb, the all-wise, the all-powerful, and it is well that you
should have done these things.</q></p>

<p><q>However,</q> continued Maal Dweb, <q>the repetition of even the
most remarkable thaumaturgies can grow monotonous after a certain
number of times. I do not think that I shall deal again in this
fashion with any woman, nor deal thus with any man. Is it not well,
Mong Lut, that I should vary my sorceries in future? Am I not Maal
Dweb, the all-resourceful?</q></p>

<p><q>Indeed, you are Maal Dweb,</q> agreed the automaton, <q>and it
would be well for you to diversify your enchantments.</q></p>

<p>Maal Dweb, in his manner, was not ill pleased with the answers that
the automaton had given. He cared little for converse, other than the
iron echoing of his metal servitors, who assented always to all that
he said, and who spared him the tedium of arguments. And it may have
been that there were times when he wearied a little even of this, and
preferred the silence of the petrified women, or the muteness of the
beasts that could no longer call themselves men.</p>
