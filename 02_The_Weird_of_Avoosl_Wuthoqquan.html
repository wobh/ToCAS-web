<h3>I</h3>

<p><q>Give, give, O magnanimous and liberal lord of the poor,</q>
cried the beggar.</p>

<p>Avoosl Wuthoqquan, the richest and most avaricious money-lender in
all Commoriom, and, by that token, in the whole of Hyperborea, was
startled from his train of reverie by the sharp, eerie, cicada-like
voice. He eyed the supplicant with acidulous disfavor. His
meditations, as he walked homeward that evening, had been splendidly
replete with the shining of costly metals, with coins and ingots and
gold-work and argentry, and the flaming or sparkling of many-tinted
gems in rills, rivers and cascades, all flowing toward the coffers of
Avoosl Wuthoqquan. Now the vision had flown; and this untimely and
obstreporous voice was imploring for alms.</p>


<p><q>I have nothing for you.</q> His tones were like the grating of a
shut clasp.</p>

<p><q>Only two pazoors, O generous one, and I will prophesy.</q></p>

<p>Avoosl Wuthoqquan gave the beggar a second glance He had never seen
so disreputable a specimen of the mendicant class in all his
wayfarings through Commoriom. The man was preposterously old, and his
mummy-brown skin, wherever visible, was webbed with wrinkles that were
like the heavy weaving of some giant jungle-spider. His rags were no
less than fabulous; and the beard that hung down and mingled with them
was hoary as the moss of a primeval juniper.</p>


<p><q>I do not require your prophecies.</q></p>

<p><q>One pazoor then.</q></p>

<p><q>No.</q></p>

<p>The eyes of the beggar became evil and malignant in their hollow
sockets, like the heads of two poisonous little pit-vipers in their
holes.</p>

<p><q>Then, O Avoosl Wuthoqquan,</q> he hissed, <q>I will prophesy
gratis. Harken to your weird: the godless and exceeding love which you
bear to all material things, and your lust therefor, shall lead you on
a strange quest and bring you to a doom whereof the stars and the sun
will alike be ignorant. The hidden opulence of earth shall allure you
and ensnare you; and earth itself shall devour you at the
last.</q></p>

<p><q>Begone,</q> said Avoosl Wuthoqquan. <q>The weird is more than
a trifle cryptic in its earlier clauses; and the final clause is
somewhat platitudinous. I do not need a beggar to tell me the common
fate of mortality.</q></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was many moons later, in that year which became known to
preglacial historians as the year of the Black Tiger.</p>

<p>Avoosl Wuthoqquan sat in a lower chamber of his house, which was
also his place of business. The room was obliquely shafted by the
brief, aerial gold of the reddening sunset, which fell through a
crystal window, lighting a serpentine line of irised sparks in the
jewel-studded lamp that hung from copper chains, and touching to fiery
life the tortuous threads of silver and similor in the dark
arrases. Avoosl Wuthoqquan, seated in an umber shadow beyond the aisle
of light, peered with an austere and ironic mien at his client, whose
swarthy face and somber mantle were gilded by the passing glory.</p>

<p>The man was a stranger; possibly a travelling merchant from outland
realms, the usurer thought&mdash;or else an outlander of more dubious
occupation. His narrow, slanting, beryl-green eye, his bluish, unkempt
beard, and the uncouth cut of his sad raiment, were sufficient proof
of his alienage in Commoriom.</p>

<p><q>Three hundred djals is a large sum,</q> said the money-lender
thoughtfully. <q>Moreover, I do not know you. What security have you
to offer?</q></p>

<p>The visitor produced from the bosom of his garment a small bag of
tiger-skin, tied at the mouth with sinew, and opening the bag with a
deft movement, poured on the table before Avoosl Wuthoqquan two uncut
emeralds of immense size and flawless purity. They flamed at the heart
with a cold and ice-green fire as they caught the slanting sunset; and
a greedy spark was kindled in the eyes of the usurer. But he spoke
coolly and indifferently.</p>

<p><q>It may be that I can loan you one hundred and fifty
djals. Emeralds are hard to dispose of; and if you should not return
to claim the gems and pay me the money, I might have reason to repent
my generosity. But I will take the hazard.</q></p>

<p><q>The loan I ask is a mere tithe of their value,</q> protested
the stranger. <q>Give me two hundred and fifty djals... There are
other money-lenders in Commoriom, I am told.</q></p>

<p><q>Two hundred djals is the most I can offer. It is true that the
gems are not without value. But you may have stolen them. How am I to
know? It is not my habit to ask indiscreet questions.</q></p>

<p><q>Take them,</q> said the stranger, hastily. He accepted the
silver coins which Avoosl Wuthoqquan counted out, and offered no
further protest. The usurer watched him with a sardonic smile as he
departed, and drew his own inferences. He felt sure that the jewels
had been stolen, but was in no wise perturbed or disquieted by this
fact. No matter who they had belonged to, or what their history, they
would form a welcome and valuable addition to the coffers of Avoosl
Wuthoqquan. Even the smaller of the two emeralds would have been
absurdly cheap at three hundred djals; but the usurer felt no
apprehension that the stranger would return to claim them at any
time&hellip; No, the man was plainly a thief, and had been glad to rid
himself of the evidence of his guilt. As to the rightful ownership of
the gems&mdash;that was hardly a matter to arouse the concern or the
curiosity of the money-lender. They were his own property now, by
virtue of the sum in silver which had tacitly been regarded by himself
and the stranger as a price rather than a mere loan.</p>

<p>The sunset faded swiftly from the room, and a brown twilight began
to dull the metal broideries of the curtains and the colored eyes of
the gems. Avoosl Wuthoqquan lit the fretted lamp; and then, opening a
small brazen strongbox, he poured from it a flashing rill of jewels on
the table beside the emeralds. There were pale and ice-clear topazes
from Mhu Thulan, and gorgeous crystals of tourmaline from Tscho
Vulpanomi; there were chill and furtive sapphires of the north, and
arctic carnelians like frozen blood, and diamonds that were hearted
with white stars. Red, unblinking rubies glared from the coruscating
pile, chatoyants shone like the eyes of tigers, garnets and
alibraundines gave their somber flames to the lamplight amid the
restless hues of opals. Also, there were other emeralds, but none so
large and flawless as the two that he had acquired that evening.</p>

<p>Avoosl Wuthoqquan sorted out the gems in gleaming rows and circles,
as he had done so many times before; and he set apart all the emeralds
with his new acquisitions at one end, like captains leading a file. He
was well pleased with his bargain, well satisfied with his overflowing
caskets. He regarded the jewels with an avaricious love, a miserly
complacence; and one might have thought that his eyes were little
beads of jasper, set in his leathery face as in the smoky parchment
cover of some olden book of doubtful magic. Money and precious
gems&mdash;these things alone, he thought, were immutable and
non-volatile in a world of never-ceasing change and fugacity.</p>

<p>His reflections, at this point, were interrupted by a singular
occurrence. Suddenly and without warning&mdash;for he had not touched
or disturbed them in any manner&mdash;the two large emeralds started
to roll away from their companions on the smooth, level table of black
ogga-wood; and before the startled money-lender could put out his hand
to stop them, they had vanished over the opposite edge and had fallen
with a muffled rattling on the carpeted floor.</p>

<p>Such behavior was highly eccentric and peculiar, not to say
unaccountable; but the usurer leapt to his feet with no other thought
save to retrieve the jewels. He rounded the table in time to see that
they had continued their mysterious rolling and were slipping through
the outer door, which the stranger in departing had left slightly
ajar. This door gave on a courtyard; and the courtyard, in turn,
opened on the streets of Commoriom.</p>

<p>Avoosl Wuthoqquan was deeply alarmed, but was more concerned by the
prospect of losing the emeralds than by the eeriness and mystery of
their departure. He gave chase with an agility of which few would have
believed him capable, and throwing open the door, he saw the fugitive
emeralds gliding with an uncanny smoothness and swiftness across the
rough, irregular flags of the courtyard. The twilight was deepening to
a nocturnal blue; but the jewels seemed to wink derisively with a
strange phosphoric luster as he followed them. Clearly visible in the
gloom, they passed through the unbarred gate that gave on a principal
avenue, and disappeared.</p>

<p>It began to occur to Avoosl Wuthoqquan that the jewels were
bewitched; but not even in the face of an unknown sorcery was he
willing to relinquish anything for which he had paid the munificent
sum of two hundred djals. He gained the open street with a running
leap, and paused only to make sure of the direction in which his
emeralds had gone.</p>

<p>The dim avenue was almost entirely deserted; for the worthy
citizens of Commoriom, at that hour, were preoccupied with the
consumption of their evening meal. The jewels, gaining momentum, and
skimming the ground lightly in their flight, were speeding away on the
left toward the less reputable suburbs and the wild, luxuriant jungle
beyond. Avoosl Wuthoqquan saw that he must redouble his pursuit if he
were to overtake them.</p>

<p>Panting and wheezing valiantly with the unfamiliar exertion, he
renewed the chase; but in spite of all his efforts, the jewels ran
always at the same distance before him, with a maddening ease and
eerie volitation, tinkling musically at whiles on the pavement. The
frantic and bewildered usurer was soon out of breath; and being
compelled to slacken his speed, he feared to lose sight of the eloping
gems; but strangely, thereafterward, they ran with a slowness that
corresponded to his own, maintaining ever the same interval.</p>

<p>The money-lender grew desperate. The flight of the emeralds was
leading him into an outlying quarter of Commoriom where thieves and
murderers and beggars dwelt. Here he met a few passers, all of dubious
character, who stared in stupefaction at the fleeing stones, but made
no effort to stop them. Then the foul tenements among which he ran
became smaller, with wider spaces between; and soon there were only
sparse huts, where furtive lights gleamed out in the full-grown
darkness, beneath the lowering frondage of high palms.</p>

<p>Still plainly visible, and shining with a mocking phosphorescence,
the jewels fled before him on the dark road. It seemed to him,
however, that he was gaining upon them a little. His flabby limbs and
pursy body were faint with fatigue, and he was grievously winded, but
he went on in renewed hope, gasping with eager avarice. A full moon,
large and amber-tinted, rose beyond the jungle and began to light his
way.</p>

<p>Commoriom was far behind him now; and there were no more huts on
the lonely forest road, nor any other wayfarers. He shivered a
little&mdash;either with fear or the chill night air; but he did not
relax his pursuit. He was closing in on the emeralds, very gradually
but surely; and he felt that he would recapture them soon. So
engrossed was he in the weird chase, with his eyes on the ever-rolling
gems, that he failed to perceive he was no longer following an open
highway. Somehow, somewhere, he had taken a narrow path that wound
among monstrous trees whose foliage turned the moonlight to a mesh of
quicksilver with heavy, fantastic raddlings of ebony. Crouching in
grotesque menace, like giant retiarii, they seemed to close in upon
him from all sides. But the money-lender was oblivious of their
shadowy threats, and heeded not the sinister strangeness and solitude
of the jungle path, nor the dank odors that lingered beneath the trees
like unseen pools.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer he came to the fleeting gems, till they ran and
flickered tantalizingly a little beyond his reach, and seemed to look
back at him like two greenish, glowing eyes, filled with allurement
and mockery. Then, as he was about to fling himself forward in a last
and supreme effort to secure them, they vanished abruptly from view,
as if they had been swallowed by the forest shadows that lay like
sable pythons athwart the moonlit way.</p>

<p>Baffled and disconcerted, Avoosl Wuthoqquan paused and peered in
bewilderment at the place where they had disappeared. He saw that the
path ended in a cavern-mouth yawning blackly and silently before him,
and leading to unknown subterranean depths. It was a doubtful and
suspicious-looking cavern, fanged with sharp stones and bearded with
queer grasses; and Avoosl Wuthoqquan, in his cooler moments, would
have hesitated a long while before entering it. But just then he was
capable of no other impulse than the fervor of the chase and the
prompting of avarice.</p>

<p>The cavern that had swallowed his emeralds in a fashion so
nefarious was a steep incline running swiftly down into darkness. It
was low and narrow, and slippery with noisome oozings; but the
money-lender was heartened as he went on by a glimpse of the glowing
jewels, which seemed to float beneath him in the black air, as if to
illuminate his way. The incline led to a level, winding passage, in
which Avoosl Wuthoqquan began to overtake his elusive property once
more; and hope flared high in his panting bosom.</p>

<p>The emeralds were almost within reach; then, with sleightful
suddenness, they slipped from his ken beyond an abrupt angle of the
passage; and following, he paused in wonder, as if halted by an
irresistible hand. He was half blinded for some moments by the pale,
mysterious, bluish light that poured from the roof and walls of the
huge cavern into which he had emerged; and he was more than dazzled by
the multi-tinted splendor that flamed and glowed and glistened and
sparkled at his very feet.</p>

<p>He stood on a narrow ledge of stone; and the whole chamber before
and beneath him, almost to the level of this ledge, was filled with
jewels even as a granary is filled with grain! It was as if all the
rubies, opals, beryls, diamonds, amethysts, emeralds, chrysolites, and
sapphires of the world had been gathered together and poured into an
immense pit. He thought that he saw his own emeralds, lying tranquilly
and decorously in a nearer mound of the undulant mass; but there were
so many others of like size and flawlessness that he could not be sure
of them.</p>

<p>For a while, he could hardly believe the ineffable vision. Then,
with a single cry of ecstasy, he leapt forward from the ledge, sinking
almost to his knees in the shifting and tinkling and billowing
gems. In great double handfuls, he lifted the flaming and
scintillating stones and let them sift between his fingers, slowly and
voluptuously, to fall with a light clash on the monstrous
heap. Blinking joyously, he watched the royal lights and colors run in
spreading or narrowing ripples; he saw them burn like steadfast coals
and secret stars, or leap out in blazing eyes that seemed to catch
fire from each other.</p>

<p>In his most audacious dreams, the usurer had never even suspected
the existence of such riches. He babbled aloud in a rhapsody of
delight, as he played with the numberless gems; and he failed to
perceive that he was sinking deeper with every movement into the
unfathomable pit. The jewels had risen above his knees, were engulfing
his pudgy thighs, before his avaricious rapture was touched by any
thought of peril.</p>

<p>Then, startled by the realization that he was sinking into his
newfound wealth as into some treacherous quicksand, he sought to
extricate himself and return to the safety of the ledge. He floundered
helplessly; for the moving gems gave way beneath him, and he made no
progress but went deeper still, till the bright, unstable heap had
risen to his waist.</p>

<p>Avoosl Wuthoqquan began to feel a frantic terror amid the
intolerable irony of his plight. He cried out; and as if in answer,
there came a loud, unctuous, evil chuckle from the cavern behind
him. Twisting his fat neck with painful effort, so that he could peer
over his shoulder, he saw a most peculiar entity that was crouching on
a sort of shelf above the pit of jewels. The entity was wholly and
outrageously unhuman; and neither did it resemble any species of
animal, or any known god or demon of Hyperborea. Its aspect was not
such as to lessen the alarm and panic of the money-lender; for it was
very large and pale and squat, with a toad-like face and a swollen,
squidgy body and numerous cuttlefish limbs or appendages. It lay flat
on the shelf, with its chinless head and long slit-like mouth
overhanging the pit, and its cold, lidless eyes peering obliquely at
Avoosl Wuthoqquan. The usurer was not reassured when it began to speak
in a thick and loathsome voice, like the molten tallow of corpses
dripping from a wizard's kettle.</p>

<p><q>Ho! what have we here?</q> it said. <q>By the black altar of
Tsathoggua, 'tis a fat money-lender, wallowing in my jewels like a
lost pig in a quagmire!</q></p>

<p><q>Help me!</q> cried Avoosl Wuthoqquan. <q>See you not that I
am sinking?</q></p>

<p>The entity gave its oleaginous chuckle. <q>Yes, I see your
predicament, of course&hellip; What are you doing here?</q></p>

<p><q>I came in search of my emeralds&mdash;two fine and flawless
stones for which I have just paid the sum of two hundred
djals.</q></p>

<p><q>Your emeralds?</q> said the entity. <q>I fear that I must
contradict you. The jewels are mine. They were stolen not long ago
from this cavern, in which I have been wont to gather and guard my
subterranean wealth for many ages. The thief was frightened
away&hellip; when he saw me&hellip; and I suffered him to go. He had
taken only the two emeralds; and I knew that they would return to
me&mdash;as my jewels always return&mdash;whenever I choose to call
them. The thief was lean and bony, and I did well to let him go; for
now, in place, there is a plump and well-fed usurer.</q></p>

<p>Avoosl Wuthoqquan, in his mounting terror, was barely able to
comprehend the words or to grasp their implications. He had sunk
slowly but steadily into the yielding pile; and green, yellow, red,
and violet gems were blinking gorgeously about his bosom and sifting
with a light tinkle beneath his armpits.</p>

<p><q>Help! help!</q> he wailed. <q>I shall be engulfed!</q></p>

<p>Grinning sardonically, and showing the cloven tip of a fat, white
tongue, the singular entity slid from the shelf with boneless ease;
and spreading its flat body on the pool of gems, into which it hardly
sank, it slithered forward to a position from which it could reach the
frantic usurer with its octopus-like members. It dragged him free with
a single motion of incredible celerity. Then, without pause or
preamble or further comment, in a leisurely and methodical manner, it
began to devour him.</p>
