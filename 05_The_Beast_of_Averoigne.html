<h3>1. The Deposition of Brother Gerome</h3>

<p>I, a poor scrivener and the humblest monk of the Benedictine Abbey
of Perigon, have been asked by our abbot Theophile to write down this
record of a strange evil that is still rampant, still unquelled. And,
ere I have done writing, it may be that the evil shall come forth
again from its lurking-place, and again be manifest.</p>

<p>We, the friars of Perigon, and all others who have knowledge of
this thing, agree that its advent was coeval with the first rising of
the red comet which still burns nightly, a flying balefire, above the
moonless hills. Like Satan's rutilant hair, trailing on the wind of
Gehenna as he hastens worldward, it rose below
the <ins>Dragon</ins> <del>Lion</del> in early summer; and now it
follows the Scorpion toward the western woods. Some say that the
horror came from the comet, flying without wings to earth across the
stars. And truly, before this summer of 1369, and the lifting of that
red, disastrous scourge upon the heavens, there was no rumor or legend
of such a thing in all Averoigne.</p>

<p>As for me, I must deem that the beast is a spawn of the seventh
hell, a foulness born of the bubbling, flame-blent ooze; for it has no
likeness to the beasts of earth, to the creatures of air and
water. And the comet may well have been the fiery vehicle of its
coming.</p>

<p>To me, for my sins and unworthiness, was it first given to behold
the beast. Surely the sight thereof was a warning of those ways which
lead to perdition: for on that occasion I had broken the rule of
St. Benedict which forbids eating during a one-day's errand away from
the monastery. I had tarried late, after bearing a letter from
Theophile to the good priest of Ste. Zenobie, though I should have
been back well before evensong. And also, apart from eating, I had
drunk the mellow white wine of Ste. Zenobie with its kindly
people. Doubtless because I had done these things, I met the nameless,
night-born terror in the woods behind the abbey when I returned.</p>

<p>The day had vanished, fading unaware; and the long summer eve,
without moon, had thickened to a still and eldritch darkness ere I
approached the abbey postern. And hurrying along the forest path, I
felt an eerie fear of the gnarled, hunchback oaks and their pit-deep
shadows. And when I saw between their antic boughs the vengefully
streaming fire of the new comet, which seemed to pursue me as I went,
the goodly warmth of the wine died out and I began to regret my
truancy. For I knew that the comet was a harbinger of ill, an omen of
death and Satanry to come.</p>

<p>Now, as I passed among the ancient trees that tower thickly,
growing toward the postern, I thought that I beheld a light from one
of the abbey windows and was much cheered thereby. But, going on, I
saw that the light was near at hand, beneath a lowering bough beside
my path; and moreover, it moved as with the flitting of a restless
fenfire, and was wholly dissimilar to the honest glow of a lamp,
lantern or taper. And the light was of changeable color, being pale as
a corposant, or ruddy as new-spilled blood, or green as the poisonous
distillation that surrounds the moon.</p>

<p>Then, with ineffable terror, I beheld the thing to which the light
clung like a hellish nimbus, moving as it moved, and revealing dimly
the black abomination of head and limbs that were not those of any
creature wrought by God. The horror stood erect, rising to the height
of a tall man, and it moved with the swaying of a great serpent, and
its members undulated as if they were boneless. The round black head,
having no visible ears or hair, was thrust foreward on a neck of
snakish length. Two eyes, small and lidless, glowing hotly as coals
from a wizard's brazier, were set low and near together in the
<ins>noseless</ins> <del>formless</del> face above the serrate
gleaming of bat-like teeth.</p>

<p>This much I saw, and no more, ere the thing went past me with the
strange nimbus flaring from venomous green to a wrathful red. Of its
actual shape, and the number of its limbs, I could form no just
notion. It uttered no sound, and its motion was altogether
silent. Running and slithering rapidly, it disappeared in the
bough-black night, among the antique oaks; and I saw the hellish light
no more.</p>

<p>I was nigh dead with fear when I reached the abbey and sought
admittance at the postern. And the porter who came at last to admit
me, after I had knocked many times, forbore to chide me for my
tardiness when I told him of that which I had seen in the moonless
wood.</p>

<p>On the morrow, I was called before Theophile, who rebuked me
sternly for my breach of discipline, and imposed a penance of daylong
solitude. Being forbidden to hold speech with the others, I did not
hear till the second morn of the thing that was found before nones in
the wood behind Perigon, where I had met the nameless beast.</p>

<p>The thing was a great stag which had been slain in some ungodly
fashion, not by wolf or hunter or poacher. It was unmarked by any
wound, other than a wide gash that had laid bare the spine from neck
to tail; and the spine itself had been shattered and the white marrow
sucked therefrom; but no other portion of the stag had been
devoured. None could surmise the nature of the beast that slew and
ravened in such a manner; but many, for the first time, began to
credit my tale, which the abbot and the brothers had hitherto looked
upon as a sort of drunken dream. Verily, they said, a creature from
the Pit was abroad, and this creature had killed the stag and had
sucked the marrow from its broken spine. And I, aghast with the
recollection of that loathly vision, marveled at the mercy of God,
which had permitted me to escape the doom of the stag.</p>

<p>None other, it seemed, had beheld the monster on that occasion; for
all the monks, save me, had been asleep in the dormitory; and
Theophile had retired early to his cell. But, during the nights that
followed the slaying of the stag, the presence of this baleful thing
was made manifest to all.</p>

<p>Now, night by night, the comet greatened, burning like an evil mist
of blood and fire, while the stars bleached before it and terror
shadowed the thoughts of men. And in our prayers, from prime to
evensong, we sought to deprecate the unknown ills which the comet
would bring in its train. And day by day, from peasants, priests,
woodcutters and others who came to visit the abbey, we heard the tale
of fearsome and mysterious depredations, similar in all ways to the
killing of the stag.</p>

<p>Dead wolves were found with their chines laid open and the spinal
marrow gone; and an ox and a horse were treated in like fashion. Then,
it would seem, the beast grew bolder&mdash;or else it wearied of such
humble prey as deer and wolves, horses and oxen.</p>

<p>At first, it did not strike at living men, but assailed the
helpless dead like some foul eater of carrion. Two freshly buried
corpses were found lying in the cemetery at Ste. Zenobie, where the
thing had dug them from their graves and had laid open their
vertebrae. In each case, only a little of the marrow had been eaten;
but as if in rage or disappointment, the cadavers had been torn into
shreds from crown to heel, and the tatters of their flesh were mixed
inextricably with the rags of their cerements. From this, it would
seem that only the spinal marrow of creatures newly killed was
pleasing to the monster.</p>

<p>Thereafter the dead were not molested; but a grievous toll was
taken from the living. On the night following the desecration of the
graves, two charcoal-burners, who plied their trade in the forest at a
distance of no more than a mile from Perigon, were slain foully in
their hut. Other charcoal-burners, dwelling nearby, head the shrill
screams that fell to sudden silence; and peering fearfully through the
chinks of their bolted doors, they saw anon in the grey starlight the
departure of a black, obscenely glowing shape that issued from the
hut. Not till dawn did they dare to verify the fate of their hapless
fellows, who, they then discovered, had been served in the same manner
as the wolves and other victims of the beast.</p>

<p>When the tale of this happening was brought to the abbey, Theophile
called me before him and questioned me closely anent the apparition
which I had encountered. He, like the others, had doubted me first,
deeming that I was frightened by a shadow or by some furtive creature
of the wood. But, after the series of atrocious maraudings, it was
plain to all that a fiendish thing such as had never been fabled in
Averoigne, was abroad and ravening through the summer woods. And
moreover it was plain that this thing was the same which I had beheld
on the eve of my return from Ste. Zenobie.</p>

<p>Our good abbot was greatly exercised over this evil, which had
chosen to manifest itself in the neighborhood of the abbey, and whose
depredations were all committed within a five-hours' journey of
Perigon. Pale from his over-strict austerities and vigils, with hollow
cheeks and burning eyes, Theophile called me before him and made me
tell my story over and over, listening as one who flagellates himself
for a fancied sin. And though I, like all others, was deeply sensible
of this hellish horror and the scandal of its presence, I marvelled
somewhat at the godly wrath and indignation of our abbot, in whom
blazed a martial ardor against the minions of Asmodai. <q>Truly,</q>
he said, <q>there is a great devil among us, that has risen with the
comet from Malebolge. We, the monks of Perigon, must go forth with
cross and holy water to hunt the devil in its hidden lair, which lies
haply at our very portals.</q></p>

<p>So, on the afternoon of that same day, Theophile, together with
myself and six others chosen for their hardihood, sallied forth from
the abbey and made search of the mighty forest for miles around,
entering with lifted crosses, by torchlight, the deep caves to which
we came, but finding no fiercer thing than wolf or badger. Also, we
searched the vaults of the ruined castle of Faussesflammes, which is
said to be haunted by vampires. But nowhere could we trace the sable
monster, or find any sign of its lairing.</p>

<p>Since then, the middle summer has gone by with nightly deeds of
terror, beneath the blasting of the comet. Beasts, men, children,
women, have been done to death by the monster, which, though seeming
to haunt mainly the environs of the abbey, has ranged afield even to
the shores of the river Isoile and the gates of La Fr&ecirc;naie and
Ximes. And some have beheld the monster at night, a black and
slithering foulness clad in changeable luminescence; but no man has
ever beheld it by day.</p>

<p>Thrice has the horror been seen in the woods behind the abbey; and
once, by full moonlight, a brother peering from his window descried it
in the abbey garden, as it glided between the rows of peas and
turnips, going toward the forest. And all agree that the thing is
silent, uttering no sound, and is swifter in its motion than the
weaving viper.</p>

<p>Much have these occurrences preyed on our abbot, who keeps to his
cell in unremitting prayer and vigil, and comes forth no longer, as
was his wont, to dine and hold converse with the guests of the
abbey. Pale and meager as a dying saint he grows, and a strange
illness devours him as if with perpetual fever; and he mortifies the
flesh till he totters with weakness. And we others, living in the fear
of God, and abhorring the deeds of Satan, can only pray that the
unknown scourge be lifted from the land, and pass with the passing of
the comet.</p>

was found dead in his cell. His body was in the same condition, had
been served in the same manner, as the other victims of the
Beast.]</p></aside>

<h3>2. The Letter of Theophile to Sister Ther&egrave;se</h3>

<p>&hellip; To you, my sister in God as well as by consanguinity, I
must ease my mind (if this be possible) by writing again of the dread
thing that harbors close to Perigon: for this thing has struck once
more within the abbey walls, coming in darkness and without sound or
other ostent than the Phlegethonian luster that surrounds its body and
members.</p>

<p>I have told you of the death of Brother Gerome, slain at evening,
in his cell, while he was copying an Alexandrian manuscript. Now the
fiend has become even bolder; for last night it entered the dormitory,
where the brothers sleep in their robes, girded and ready to arise
instantly. And without waking the others, on whom it must have cast a
Lethean spell, it took Brother Augustin, slumbering on his pallet at
the end of the row. And the fell deed was not discovered fill
daybreak, when the monk who slept nearest to Augustin awakened and saw
his body, which lay face downward with the back of the robe and the
flesh beneath a mass of bloody tatters.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the Beast was not beheld by anyone; but at other
times, full often, it has been seen around the abbey; and its
craftiness and hardihood are beyond belief, except as those of an
arch-devil. And I know not where the horror will end; for exorcisms
and the sprinkling of holy water at all doors and windows have failed
to prevent the intrusion of the Beast; and God and Christ and all the
holy Saints are deaf to our prayers.</p>

<p>Of the terror laid upon Averoigne by this thing, and the bale and
mischief it has wrought outside the abbey, I need not tell, since all
this will have come to you as a matter of common report. But here, at
Perigon, there is much that I would not have rumored publicly, lest
the good fame of the abbey should suffer. I deem it an humiliating
thing, and a derogation and pollution of our sanctity, that a foul
fiend should have ingress to our halls unhindered and at will.</p>

<p>There are strange whispers among the brothers, who believe that
Satan himself has risen to haunt us. Several have met the Beast even
in the chapel, where it has left an unspeakably blasphemous sign of
its presence. Bolts and locks are vain against it; and vain is the
lifted cross to drive it away. It comes and goes at its own choosing;
and they who behold it flee in irrestrainable terror. None knows where
it will strike next; and there are those among the brothers who
believe it menaces me, the elected abbot of Perigon; since many have
seen it gliding along the hall outside my cell. And Brother
Constantin, the cellarer, who returned late from a visit to Vyones not
long ago, swears that he saw it by moonlight as it climbed the wall
toward that window of my cell which faces the great forest. And seeing
Constantin, the thing dropped to the ground like a huge ape and
vanished among the trees.</p>

<p>All, it would seem, save me, have beheld the monster. And now, my
sister, I must confess a strange thing, which above all else would
attest the influential power of Hell in this matter, and the hovering
of the wings of Asmodai about Perigon.</p>

<p>Each night, since the coming of the comet and the Beast, I have
retired early to my cell, with the intention of spending the nocturnal
hours in vigil and prayer, as I am universally believed to do. And
each night a stupor falls upon me as I kneel before Christ on the
silver crucifix; and oblivion steeps my senses in its poppy; and I lie
without dreams on the cold floor till dawn. Of that which goes on in
the abbey I know nothing; and all the brothers might be done to death
by the Beast, and their spines broken and sucked as is its invariable
fashion, without my knowledge.</p>

<p>Haircloth have I worn, and thorns and thistle-burs have I strewn on
the floor, to awake me from this evil and ineluctable slumber that is
like the working of some Orient drug. But the thorns and thistles are
as a couch of paradisal ease, and I feel them not till dawn. And dim
and confused are my senses when I awaken; and deep languor thralls my
limbs. And day by day a lethal weakness grows upon me, which all
ascribe to saintly pernoctations of prayer and austerity.</p>

<p>Surely I have become the victim of a spell, and am holden by a
baleful enchantment while the Beast is abroad with its hellish
doings. Heaven, in its inscrutable wisdom, punishing me for what sin I
know not, has delivered me utterly to this bondage and has thrust me
down the sloughs of a Stygian despair.</p>

<p>Ever I am haunted by an eerie notion, that the Beast comes nightly
to earth from the red comet which passes like a fiery wain above
Averoigne; and by day it returns to the comet, having eaten its fill
of that provender for which it seeks. And only with the comet's fading
will the horror cease to harry the land and infest Perigon. But I know
not if this thought is madness, or a whisper from the Pit.</p>

<p>Pray for me, Ther&egrave;se, in my bewitchment and my despair: for
God has abandoned me, and the yoke of hell has somehow fallen upon me;
and naught can I do to defend the abbey from this evil. And I, in
turn, pray that such things may touch you not nor approach you in the
quiet cloisters of the convent at Ximes&hellip;.</p>

<h3>3. The Story of Luc le Chaudronnier</p></h3>

<p>Old age, like a moth in some fading arras, will gnaw my memories
oversoon, as it gnaws the memories of all men. Therefore I write this
record of the true origin and slaying of that creature known as the
Beast of Averoigne. And when I have ended the writing, the record
shall be sealed in a brazen box, and that box be set in a secret
chamber of my house at Ximes, so that no man shall learn the dreadful
verity of this matter till many years and decades have gone
by. Indeed, it were not well for such evil prodigies to be divulged
while any who took part in the happening are still on the earthward
side of Purgatory. And at present the truth is known only to me and to
certain others who are sworn to maintain secrecy.</p>

<p>The ravages of the Beast, however, are common knowledge, and have
become a tale with which to frighten children. Men say that it slew
fifty people, night by night, in the summer of 1369, devouring in each
case the spinal marrow. It ranged mostly about the abbey of Perigon
and to Ximes and Ste. Zenobie and La Fr&ecirc;naie. Its nativity and
lairing-place were mysteries that none could unravel; and church and
state were alike powerless to curb its maraudings, so that a dire
terror fell upon the land and people went to and fro as in the shadow
of death.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, because of my own commerce with occult
things and with the spirits of darkness, the baleful Beast was the
subject of my concern. I knew that it was no creature of earth or of
the terrene hells, but had come with the flaming comet from ulterior
space; but regarding its character and attributes and genesis, I could
learn no more at first than any other. Vainly I consulted the stars
and made use of geomancy and necromancy; and the familiars whom I
interrogated professed themselves ignorant, saying that the Beast was
altogether alien and beyond the ken of sublunar devils.</p>

<p>Then I bethought me of the ring of Eibon, which I had inherited
from my fathers, who were also wizards. The ring had come down, it was
said, from ancient Hyperborea; and it was made of a redder gold than
any that the earth yields in latter cycles, and was set with a great
purple gem, somber and smouldering, whose like is no longer to be
found. And in the gem an antique demon was held captive, a spirit from
pre-human worlds and ages, which would answer the interrogation of
sorcerers.</p>

<p>So, from a rarely opened casket, I brought out the ring of Eibon
and made such preparations as were needful for the questioning of the
demon. And when the purple stone was held inverted above a small
brazier filled with hotly burning amber, the demon made answer,
speaking in a voice that was like the shrill singing of fire. It told
me the origin of the Beast, which belonged to a race of stellar devils
that had not visited the earth since the foundering of Atlantis; and
it told me the attributes of the Beast, which, in its own proper form,
was invisible and intangible to men, and could manifest itself only in
a fashion supremely abominable. Moreover, it informed me of a method
by which the Beast could be banished, if overtaken in a tangible
shape. And even to me, the student of darkness [and evil], the
revelations were a source of horror and surprise.</p>

<p>Musing on these dark matters, I waited among my books and braziers
and alembics, for the stars had warned me that my intervention would
be required in good time.</p>

<p>Toward the end of August, when the great comet was beginning to
decline a little, there occurred the lamentable death of Sister
Ther&egrave;se, killed by the Beast in her cell at the Benedictine
convent of Ximes. On this occasion, the Beast was plainly seen by late
passers as it ran down the convent wall by moonlight from a window;
and others met it in the shadowy streets or watched it climb the city
ramparts, running like a monstrous beetle or spider on the sheer stone
as it fled from Ximes to regain its hidden lair.</p>

<p>To me, following the death of Ther&egrave;se, there came privily
the town marshal, together with a priest from the household of the
Bishop of Ximes. And the two, albeit with palpable hesitation, begged
my advice and assistance in the laying of the Beast.</p>

<p><q>You, Messire le Chaudronnier,</q> they said, <q>are reputed
to know the arcanic arts of sorcery, and the spells that summon or
dismiss evil demons and other spirits. Therefore, in dealing with this
devil, it may be that you shall succeed where all others have
failed. Not willingly do we employ you in the matter, since it is not
seemly for the church and the law to ally themselves with
wizardry. But the need is desperate, lest the demon should take other
victims; and in return for your aid, we can promise you a goodly
reward of gold and a guarantee of lifelong immunity from all
inquisition and prosecution which your doings might otherwise
invite. The Bishop of Ximes, and the Archbishop of Vyones, are privy
to this offer, which must remain secret.</q></p>

<p><q>I ask no reward,</q> I replied, <q>if it be in my power to
rid Averoigne of this scourge. But you have set me a difficult task,
and I must prepare myself for the undertaking, in which I shall
require certain aid.</q></p>

<p><q>All assistance that we can give you shall be yours to
command,</q> they said. <q>Men-at-arms shall attend you, if need be;
and all doors shall be opened at your request. We have consulted
Theophile, the abbot of Perigon, and the grief-smitten brother of the
lately slain Ther&egrave;se, who is most zealous for the laying of the
fiend, and will admit you to the abbey. The horror seems to center
thereabout, and two of the monks have been done to death, and the
abbot himself, it is rumored, has been haunted by the
Beast. Therefore, it may be that you will wish to visit
Perigon.</q></p>

<p>I reflected briefly, and said:</p>

<p><q>Go now, but send to me, an hour before sunset, two men-at-arms
with horses and a third steed; and let the men be chosen for their
valor and discretion: for this very night I shall visit the
abbey.</q></p>

<p>Now, when the priest and the marshal had gone, I spent several
hours in making ready for my journey. It was necessary, above all
other things, to compound a certain rare powder that had been
recommended by the demon in the purple gem; for only by the casting of
this powder could the Beast be driven away before its time. The
ingredients of the powder were named in the Book of Eibon, that manual
written by an old Hyper-borean wizard, who in his day had dealt with
ultra-mundane spirits akin to the demon of the comet; and had also
been the owner of the ring.</p>

<p>Having compounded the powder, I stored it in a bag of
viper-skin. And soon after I had finished my preparations, the two
men-at-arms and the horses came to my house, as had been
stipulated.</p>

<p>The men were stout and tested warriors, clad in chain-mail, and
carrying spears and swords. I mounted the third horse, a black and
spirited mare, and we rode forth from Ximes toward Perigon, taking a
direct and little-used way which ran for many miles through the
werewolf-haunted forest.</p>

<p>My companions were taciturn, speaking only in brief answer to some
question; and this pleased me, for I knew that they would maintain a
discreet silence regarding that which might occur before dawn. Swiftly
we rode, while the sun sank in a redness as of welling blood among the
tall trees; and the darkness wove its thickening webs from bough to
bough, closing upon us like some inextricable net of death and
evil. Deeper we went, into the brooding woods; and even I, the master
of sorceries, trembled a little at the knowledge of all that was
abroad in the darkness.</p>

<p>Undelayed and unmolested, however, we came to the abbey at late
moonrise, when all the monks, except the aged porter, had retired to
their dormitory. The porter, who had received word of our coming,
would have admitted us; but this, as it happened, was no part of my
plan. Saying I had reason to believe that the Beast would re-enter the
abbey that very night, I told the porter my intention of waiting
outside the walls to intercept it, and merely asked him to accompany
us in a tour of the building's exterior, so that he could point out
the various rooms. This he did, and during the course of the tour, he
indicated a certain high window in the second story as being that of
the abbot Theophile's chamber. The window faced the forest, and I
remarked the abbot's rashness in leaving it open. This, the porter
told me, was his invariable habit. Behind the window we could see the
glimmering of a taper, as if the abbot were keeping late vigil.</p>

<p>We had committed our horses to the porter's care. After he had
conducted us around the abbey and had left us, we returned to the
space beneath Theophile's window and began our long watch in
silence.</p>

<p>Pale and hollow as the face of a corpse, the moon rose higher,
swimming above the somber oaks and pines, and pouring a spectral
silver on the grey stone of the abbey walls. In the west the comet
flared among the lusterless Signs, veiling the lifted sting of the
Scorpion as it sank.</p>

<p>We waited hour by hour in the shortening shadow of a high pine,
where none could see us from the abbey. When the moon had passed over,
falling westward, the shadow began to lengthen toward the wall. All
was mortally still, and we saw no movement, apart from the slow
changing of the light and shade. Half-way between midnight and dawn,
the taper went out in Theophile's cell, as if it had burned to the
socket; and thereafter the room remained dark.</p>

<p>Unquestioning, with ready spears, the two men-at-arms companioned
me in that vigil. Well they knew the demonian terror which they might
face before dawn; but there was no trace of trepidation in their
bearing. And knowing much that they could not know, I held in my hands
for instant use the bag of viper-skin that contained the Hyperborean
powder.</p>

<p>The men stood nearer than I to the forest, facing it perpetually
according to a strict order that I had given. But nothing stirred in
the fretted gloom; and the skies grew paler, as if with morning
twilight. Then, an hour before sunrise, when the shadow of the great
pine had reached the wall and was climbing toward Theophile's window,
there came the thing which I had anticipated. Very suddenly it came,
and with no warning of its nearness, a horror of hellish red light,
swift as a kindling, windblown flame, that leapt from the forest gloom
and sprang upon us where we stood stiff and weary from our night-long
vigil.</p>

<p>One of the men-at-arms was borne to the ground, and I saw above
him, in a floating redness as of blood, the black and serpentine form
of the Beast. A round and snakish head, without ears or nose, was
tearing at the man's armor with sharp innumerable teeth, and I heard
the teeth grate and clash on the linked iron as I stepped forward and
flung the powder of Eibon at the Beast. The second man-at-arms,
undaunted, would have assailed it with his spear, but this I
forbade.</p>

<p>The floating powder, fine as a dust of mummia, seemed to dim the
bloody light as it fell; and the Beast relinquished the fallen man,
writhing away like a burnt serpent from the fire. Its members and body
were loathfully convulsed; and the thing seemed to change horribly
beneath our gaze, undergoing an incredible metamorphosis. Moment by
moment it took on the wavering similitude of man, like a werewolf that
returns from his beasthood; and the red light grew dimmer, and the
unclean blackness of its flesh appeared to flow and swirl, assuming
the weft of cloth, and becoming the folds of a dark robe and cowl such
as are worn by the Benedictines. Then, from the cowl, a face began to
peer, glimmering pale and thin in the shadow; and the thing covered
its face with sooty claws that were turning into hands, and shrank
away from me as I pressed upon it, sprinkling it with the remainder of
the powder.</p>

<p>Now I had driven it against the abbey wall; and there, with a wild,
despairing cry that was half-human, half-demoniac, the thing turned
from me and clawed frantically at the gray stone as if it would climb
toward the abbot's window in that monstrous fashion that had been its
wont. Almost, for a breath, it seemed to run upward, hanging to the
wall like a bat or a great beetle. But the change had progressed too
far, and it dropped back in the shadow of a pine, and tottering
strangely as if with sudden mortal weakness, fell to the ground and
lay huddled in its monkish garments like a black night-bird with
broken vans.</p>

<p>The rays of the gibbous moon, sifting thinly through the boughs,
lay cold and cadaverous on the dead face; though the body was immersed
in shadow. And the face, even as I had expected, was that of the abbot
Theophile, who had once been pointed out to me in Ximes. Already the
peace of death was upon him; and horror had left no sign on the shut
eyelids and the sealed lips; and there was no mark on the worn and
haggard cheeks, other than that which might come from the saintly
rigor of prolonged austerities.</p>

<p>The man-at-arms who had been struck down by the Beast was unharmed,
though sorely bruised beneath his mail. He and his fellow stood beside
me, saying naught; and I knew that they had recognized the dead
abbot. So, while the moon grew grey with the nearness of dawn, I made
them swear an awful oath of secrecy, and enjoined them to bear
faithful witness to the statement I must make before the monks of
Perigon.</p>

<p>Then, having settled this matter, so that the good renown of the
holy Theophile should rest unharmed, we aroused the porter and
acquainted him with the abbot's lamentable death. And we told this
story, averring that the Beast had come upon us unaware, and had
gained the abbot's cell before we could prevent it, and had come forth
again, carrying Theophile with its snakish members as if to bear him
away to the sunken comet. Then, by means of a wizard powder, I had
routed the unclean Beast, compelling it to relinquish its prey. And
the thing had vanished in a cloud of sulphurous fire and vapor; but
Theophile had died from the horror of his plight while the Beast was
descending the wall. His death, I said, was a true martyrdom, and
would not be in vain: the Beast would no longer plague the country or
bedevil Perigon, since the use of Hyperborean powder was a sure
exorcism.</p>

<p>This tale was accepted by the Brothers, who grieved mightily for
their good abbot. Indeed, the tale was true enough in its fashion, for
Theophile had been innocent and was wholly ignorant of the foul change
that had come upon him nightly in his cell, and the deeds that were
done by the Beast through his loathfully transfigured body. Each night
the thing had come from the comet to assuage its hellish hunger; and
being otherwise impalpable and powerless, it had used the abbot for
its energumen, moulding his flesh in the image of some obscene monster
from beyond the stars.</p>

<p>After Theophile's death, the Beast was seen no more in Averoigne;
and the murderous deeds were not repeated. And in time the comet
passed to other heavens, fading slowly; and the black terror it had
wrought became a varying legend, even as all other bygone things. And
they who read this record in future ages will believe it not, saying
that no demon or malign spirit could ever have prevailed upon true
holiness. Indeed, it were well that none should believe the story: for
strange abominations pass evermore between earth and moon and athwart
the galaxies; and the gulf is haunted by that which it were madness
for man to know. Unnameable things have come to us in alien horror,
and shall come again. And the evil of the stars is not as the evil of
earth.</p>
