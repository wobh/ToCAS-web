<p>The crown of the kings of Ustaim was fashioned only from the rarest
materials that could be procured anywhere. The magically graven gold
of its circlet had been mined from a huge meteor that fell in the
southern isle of Cyntrom, shaking the isle from shore to shore with
calamitous earthquake; and the gold was harder and brighter than any
native gold of Earth, and was changeable in color from a flamelike red
to the yellow of young moons. It was set with thirteen jewels, every
one of which was unique and without fellow even in fable. These jewels
were a wonder to behold, starring the circlet with strange unquiet
fires and fulgurations terrible as the eyes of the cockatrice. But
more wonderful than all else was the stuffed gazolba-bird which formed
the superstructure of the crown, gripping the circlet with its steely
claws above the wearer's brow, and towering royally with resplendent
plumage of green, violet and vermilion. Its beak was the hue of
burnished brass, its eyes were like small dark garnets in bezels of
silver; and seven lacy, miniated quills arose from its ebon- dappled
head, and a white tail fell down in a straightly spreading fan like
the beams of some white sun behind the circle. The gazolba-bird was
the last of its kind, according to the mariners who had slain it in an
almost legendary isle beyond Sotar, far to the east of Zothique. For
nine generations it had decked the crown of Ustaim, and the kings
looked upon it as the sacred emblem of their fortunes, and a talisman
inseparable from their royalty, whose loss would be followed by grave
disaster.</p>

<p>Euvoran the son of Karpoom, was the ninth wearer of the
crown. Superbly and magnificently he had worn it for two years and ten
months, following the death of Karpoom from a surfeit of stuffed eels
and jellied salamander's eggs. On all state occasions, levees and
daily grantings of public audience and administerings of justice, it
had graced the brow of the young king and had conferred upon him a
dreadful majesty in the eyes of the beholders. Also, it had served to
conceal the lamentable increase of an early baldness.</p>

<p>It came to pass, in the late autumn of the third year of his reign,
that King Euvoran rose from a goodly breakfast of twelve courses and
twelve wines, and went forth as was his custom to the hall of justice,
which occupied an entire wing of his palace in the city of Aramoam,
looking down in several- colored marble from its palmy hills to the
rippled lazuli of the orient ocean.</p>

<p>Being well fortified by his breakfast, Euvoran felt himself
prepared to unravel the most involute skeins of legality and crime,
and was likewise ready for the meting of swift punishment to all
malefactors. And beside him, at the right arm of his kraken-sculptured
throne of ivory, there stood an executioner leaning on a huge mace
with a leaden head that was tempered to the hardness of iron. Full
often, with this mace, the bones of the more flagitious offenders were
broken immediately, or their brains were split in the kings presence
on a floor that was strewn with black sand. And beside the left arm of
the throne, a professional torturer busied himself continually with
the screws and pulleys of certain fearsome instruments of torture, as
a warning of their fate to all evil-doers. And not always idle were
the turnings of these screws and the tightenings of these pulleys, and
not always empty were the metal beds of the machines.</p>

<p>Now, on that morning, the constables of the city brought before
King Euvoran only a few petty thieves and suspicious vagrants; and
there were no cases of felony such as would have warranted the
wielding of the mace or the use of the torture-implements. So the
king, who had looked forward to a pleasurable session, was somewhat
balked and disappointed; and he questioned with much severity the
minor culprits before him, trying to extort from each of them, in
turn, an admission of some graver crime than that whereof he was
accused. But it seemed that the pilferers were innocent of aught but
pilfering; and the vagrants were guilty of naught worse than vagrancy;
and Euvoran began to think that the morning would offer scant
entertainment. For the bastinado was the heaviest punishment that he
could legally impose on such misdemeanants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away with these mackerel!&rdquo; he roared to the officers, and
his crown shook with indignation, and the tall gazolba-bird on the
crown appeared to nod and bow. &ldquo;Away with them, for they pollute my
presence. Give each of them a hundred strokes with the hardwood briar
on the bare sole of each foot, and forget not the heels. Then drive
them forth from Aramoam toward the public refuse-grounds, and prod
them with red-hot tridents if they linger in their crawling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, ere the officers could obey him, there entered the hall of
justice two belated constables, haling between them a peculiar and
most unsavory individual with the long-handled, many pointed hooks
that were used in Aramoam for the apprehending of malefactors and
suspects. And though the hooks were seemingly embedded in his flesh as
well as the filthy rags that served him for raiment, the prisoner
bounded perpetually aloft in the manner of a goat, and his captors
were obliged to follow in these lively and undignified saltations, so
that the three presented the appearance of tumblers. With a final
volitation in which the officers were drawn through the air like the
tails of a kite, the incredible personage came to a pause before
Euvoran. The king regarded him in amazement, blinking rapidly, and was
not prepossessed by the singular suppleness with which he louted to
the very floor, upsetting the scarce-recovered equilibrium of the
officers, and causing them to sprawl at full length in the royal
presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! What have we now?&rdquo; said the king in an ominous
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, 'tis another vagabond,&rdquo; replied the breathless
officers, when they had regained a more respectfully inclined
position. &ldquo;He would have passed through Aramoam by the main avenue
in the fashion that you behold, without stopping, and without even
lessening the altitude of his saltations, if we had not arrested
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such behavior is highly suspicious,&rdquo; growled Euvoran
hopefully. &ldquo;Prisoner, declare your name, your nativity and
occupation, and the infamous crimes of which, beyond doubt, you are
guilty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captive, who was cross-eyed, appeared to regard Euvoran, the
royal mace-wielder, and the royal torturer and his instruments all in
a single glance. He was ill-favored to an extravagant degree, his
nose, ears and other features were all possessed of unnatural
mobility, and he grimaced perpetually in a manner that caused his
unclean beard to toss and curl like seaweed on a boiling
whirlpool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have many names,&rdquo; he replied, in an insolent voice whose
pitch was peculiarly disagreeable to Euvoran, setting his teeth on
edge like the grating of metal on glass. &ldquo;As for my nativity and
occupation, the knowledge of these, O king, would profit you
little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sirrah, you are malapert. Give answer or tongues of red-hot
iron shall question you,&rdquo; roared Euvoran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it known to you, then, that I am a necromancer, and was born
in the realm where the dawn and the sunset come together and the moon
is equal in brightness to the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! A necromancer!&rdquo; snorted the king. &ldquo;Know you not that
necromancy is a capital crime in Ustaim? Verily, we shall find means
to dissuade you from the practice of such infamies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a sign from Euvoran, the officers drew their captive toward the
instruments of torture. Much to their surprise, in view of his former
ebullience, he allowed himself to be chained supinely on the iron bed
that produced a remarkable elongation of the limbs of its
occupants. The official engineer of these miracles began to work the
levers, and the bed lengthened little by little with a surly grating,
till it seemed that the prisoner's joints would be torn apart. Inch by
inch was added to his stature; and though, after a time, he had gained
more than a half-cubit from the stretching, he appeared to experience
no discomfort whatever; and to the stupefaction of all present, it
became plain that the elasticity of his arms, legs and body was beyond
the extensibility of the rack itself; for the latter was now drawn to
its limits.</p>

<p>All were silent, viewing this prodigy; and Euvoran rose from his
seat and went over to the rack, as if doubtful of his own eyes that
testified to a thing so enormous. And the prisoner said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It were well to release me, O King Euvoran.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say you so?&rdquo; the king cried out in a rage. &ldquo;However, it
is not thus that we deal with felons in Ustaim.&rdquo; And he made a
private sign to the executioner, who came forward quickly, rearing his
massive, leaden-headed mace aloft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On your own head be it,&rdquo; said the necromancer, and he rose
instantly from the iron bed, breaking the bonds that held him, as if
they had been chains of grass. Then, towering to a terrible height,
which the wrenchings of the rack had given him, he pointed his long
forefinger, dark and sere as that of a mummy, at the king's crown; and
simultaneously he uttered a foreign word that was shrill and eldritch
as the crying of migrant fowl that pass over toward unknown shores in
the night. And lo! As if in answer to that word, there was a loud,
sudden flapping of wings above Euvoran's head and the king felt that
his brow was lightened by the crown's goodly and well-accustomed
weight. A shadow fell upon him, and he, and all who were present,
beheld above them in the air the stuffed gazolba-bird, which had been
slain more than two hundred years before by sea-faring men in a remote
isle. The wings of the bird, a living splendor, were outspread as if
for flight, and it carried still in its steely claws the rare circlet
of the crown. Librating, it hung for a little over the throne, while
the king watched it in wordless awe and consternation. Then, with
metallic whirring, its white tail deployed like the beams of a flying
sun, it flew swiftly through the open portals, and passed seaward from
Aramoam into the morning light.</p>

<p>After it, with great bounds and goatish leapings, the necromancer
followed; and no man tried to deter him. But those who saw him depart
from the city swore that he went north along the ocean-strand, while
the bird flew directly eastward, as if homing to the half-fabulous
isle of its nativity. Thereafter, as if he had gone at a single bound
into alien realms, the necromancer was not seen in Ustaim. But the
crew of a merchant galley from Sotar, landing later in Aramoam, told
how the gazolba-bird had passed over them in mid-main, a
several-colored glory still flying toward the sources of the
dayspring. And they said that the crown of changeable gold, with its
thirteen fellowless gems, was still carried by the bird. And though
they had trafficked long in the archipelagoes of wonder, and had seen
many prodigies, they deemed this thing a most rare and unexampled
portent.</p>

<p>King Euvoran, so strangely reft of that avian head-gear, with his
baldness rudely bared to the gaze of thieves and vagrants in the hall
of justice, was as one on whom the gods have sent down a sudden
bolt. If the sun had turned black in heaven, or his palace walls had
crumbled about him, his dumbfoundment would hardly have been more
excessive. For it seemed to him that his royalty had flown with that
crown which was the emblem and the talisman of his fathers. And,
moreover, the thing was wholly against nature, and the laws of god and
man were annulled thereby: since never before, in all history or
fable, had a dead bird taken flight from the kingdom of Ustaim.</p>

<p>Indeed, the loss was a dire calamity, and Euvoran, having donned a
voluminous turban of purple samite, held council with the sagest
ministers regarding the state dilemma that had thus arisen. The
ministers were no less troubled and perplexed than the king: for the
bird and the circlet were both irreplaceable. And in the meanwhile,
the rumor of this misfortune was borne abroad through Ustaim, and the
land became filled with lamentable doubt and confusion, and some of
the people began to murmur covertly against Euvoran, saying that no
man could be the rightful ruler of that country without the
gazolba-crown.</p>

<p>Then, as was the custom of the kings in a time of national
exigence, Eurovan repaired to the temple in which dwelt the god Geol,
who was a terrestrial god and the chief deity of Aramoam. Alone, with
bare head and unshod feet, as was ordained by hierarchal law, he
entered the dim adytum where the image of Geol, pot-bellied, and
wrought of earth-brown faience, reclined eternally on its back and
regarded the motes in a narrow beam of sunlight from the slotted
wall. And, falling prone in the dust that had gathered around the idol
through ages, the king gave homage to Geol, and implored an oracle to
illuminate and guide him in his need. And after an interim, a voice
issued from the god's navel, as if a subterrene rumbling had become
articulate. And the voice said to King Eurovan:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go forth and seek the gazolba in those isles that lie beneath
the orient sun. There, O king, on the far coasts of dawn, thou shalt
again behold the living bird which is the symbol and the fortune of
thy dynasty; and there, with thine own hand, thou shalt slay the
bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Euvoran was much comforted by this oracle, since the utterances of
the god were deemed infallible. And it seemed to him that the oracle
implied in plain terms that he should recover the lost crown of
Ustaim, which had the reanimated bird for its superstructure. So,
returning to the royal palace, he sent for the captains of his
proudest argosies of war, which lay then at anchor in the tranquil
harbor of Aramoam, and ordered them to make immediate provision for a
long voyage into the east and among the archipelagoes of morning.</p>

<p>When all was made ready, King Euvoran went aboard the flagship of
the fleet, which was a towering quadrireme with oars of beef-wood and
sails of stout woven byssus dyed in yellowish scarlet, and a long
gonfalon at the mast head, bearing the gazolba bird in its natural
colors on a field of heavenly cobalt. The rowers and sailors of the
quadrireme were mighty Negroes from the north; and the soldiers who
manned it were fierce mercenaries from Xylac in the west; and with
him, going aboard, the king took certain of his concubines and jesters
and other ministrants, as well as an ample store of liquors and rare
viands, so that he should lack for nothing during the voyage. And
mindful of the prophecy of Geol, the king armed himself with a longbow
and a quiver filled with parrot-feathered arrows; and he also carried
a sling of lion-leather and a blowgun of black bamboo from which tiny
poisoned darts were discharged.</p>

<p>It seemed that the gods favored the voyage; for a wind blew
strongly from the west on the morning of the departure; and the fleet,
which numbered fifteen vessels, was borne with bellying sails toward
the sea-risen sun. And the farewell clamors and shoutings of Euvoran's
people on the wharves were soon stilled by distance; and the marble
houses of Aramoam on its four palmy hills here drowned in that swiftly
foundering bank of azure which was the shoreline of Ustaim. And,
thereafter, for many days, the iron-wood beaks of the galleys clove a
softly weltering sea of indigo that rose unbroken on all sides to a
cloudless, dark-blue heaven.</p>

<p>Trusting in the oracle of Geol, that earthen god who had never
failed his fathers, the king made merry as was his wont; and reclining
beneath a saffron canopy on the poop of the quadrireme, he swilled
from an emerald beaker the wines and brandies that had lain in his
palace-vaults, storing the warmth of elder, ardent suns whereon
oblivion's black rime was fallen. And he laughed at the ribaldries of
his fools, at unquenchable ancient bawdries that had won the laughter
of other kings in the sea-lost continents of yore. And his women
diverted him with harlotries that were older than Rome or
Atlantis. And ever he kept at hand, beside his couch, the weapons
wherewith he hoped to hunt and slay again the gazolba-bird, according
to the oracle of Geol.</p>

<p>The winds were unfailing and auspicious, and the fleet sped onward,
with the great black oarsmen singing gaily at their oars, and the
gorgeous sailcloths flapping loudly, and the long banners floating on
the air like straight-blown flames. After a fortnight they came to
Sotar, whose low-lying coasts of cassia and sago barred the sea for a
hundred leagues from north to south; and in Loithe, the chief port,
they paused to inquire for the gazolba-bird. There were rumors that
the bird had passed above Sotar; and some of the people said that a
cunning sorcerer of that isle, named Iffibos, had drawn it down
through his sorcery and had closed it in a cage of sandalwood. So the
king landed in Loithe, deeming his quest perhaps already nigh to its
end, and went with certain of his captains and soldiers to visit
Iffibos, who dwelt in a retired vale among the mountains at the
island's core.</p>

<p>It was a tedious journey, and Euvoran was much annoyed by the huge
and vicious gnats of Sotar, which were no respecters of royalty, and
were always insinuating themselves under his turban. And when, after
some delay and divagation in the deep jungle, he came to the house of
Iffibos on a high, precarious crag, he found that the bird was merely
one of the bright-plumaged vultures peculiar to the region, which
Iffibos had tamed for his own amusement. So the king returned to
Loithe, after declining somewhat rudely the invitation of the
sorcerer, who wished to show him the unusual feats of falconry to
which he had trained the vulture. And in Loithe the king tarried no
longer than was needful for the laying aboard of fifty jars of the
sovereign arrack in which Sotar excels all other lands.</p>

<p>Then, coasting the southern cliffs and promontories, where the sea
bellowed prodigiously in mile-deep caverns, the ships of Euvoran
sailed beyond Sotar, and Tosk, whose people were more akin to apes and
lemurs than to men. And Euvoran asked the people for news of the
gazolba, and received only a chattering as of apes in answer. So the
king ordered his men-at-arms to catch a number of these savage
islanders and crucify them on the coco-palms for their incivility. And
the men-at-arms pursued the nimble people of Tosk for a full day among
the trees and boulders in which the isle abounded, but without
catching a single one of them. So the king contented himself by
crucifying several of the men-at-arms for their failure to obey him
and sailed on to the seven atolls of Yumatot, whose inhabitants were
mostly cannibals. And beyond Yumatot, which was the usual limit of
eastern voyaging from Ustaim, the vessels entered the Ilozian Sea, and
began to touch at partly mythic shores and islands charted only in
story.</p>

<p>It were tedious to relate the full particulars of that voyage, in
which Euvoran and his captains went ever toward the sources of the
dawn. Various and without number were the strange marvels they found
in the archipelagoes beyond Yumatot; but nowhere could they find a
single feather such as had formed part of the gazolba's plumage; and
the quaint people of those isles had never seen the bird.</p>

<p>Howbeit, the king beheld many a flock of unknown, fiery-winged fowl
that went over the galleys in mid-sea, passing between the unmarked
islets. And, landing often, he practiced his archery on lorikeets and
lyrebirds and boobies, or stalked the golden cockatoos with his
blowgun. And he chased the dodo and dinornis on shores that were
otherwise unpeopled. And once, in a sea of high-beetling barren rocks,
the fleet was assailed by mighty griffins that flew down from their
crag-built eyries, with wings shining like feathery brass under the
meridian sun, and making a harsh clangor as of shields shaken in
battle. And the griffins, being both ferocious and pertinacious, were
driven away with much difficulty by boulders hurled from the catapults
of the vessels.</p>

<p>Everywhere, as the ships drove eastward, there were multitudes of
fowl. But at the sunset of a day in the fourth moon following their
departure from Aramoam, the vessels approached a nameless isle that
towered mile-high with cliffs of black, naked basalt, around whose
base the sea cried with baffled anger, and about whose precipices
there were no wings nor voices of birds. The isle was topped with
gnarly cypresses that might have grown in a windy graveyard; and
sullenly it took the afterglow, as if drenched with a gore of
darkening blood. Far up in the cliffs there were strange columned
eaves like the dwellings of forgotten troglodytes, but seemingly
inaccessible to men; and the caves to all appearances were unoccupied
by any kind of life, though pitting the face of the isle for
leagues. And Euvoran ordered his captains to drop anchor, meaning to
search for a landing-place on the morrow: since, in his anxiety to
retrieve the gazolba, he would pass no isle of the dawnward main, not
even the unlikeliest, without due inquiry and examination.</p>

<p>Quickly fell the darkness, without moon, till the close- anchored
ships were visible to each other only by their lanterns. And Euvoran
sat at supper in his cabin, sipping the golden arrack of Sotar between
mouthfuls of mango-jelly and phenicopter's meat. And, saving a small
watch on each of the vessels, the sailors and men-at-arms were all at
evening mess; and the rowers ate their figs and lentils in the
oar-decks. Then, from the watches, there was a wild shouting of alarm,
and the shouting ceased in a moment, and each of the vessels rocked
and sagged in the water, as if a monstrous weight had settled upon
it. No man knew the thing that had happened, but everywhere there was
turmoil and confusion, some saying that the fleet was attacked by
pirates. Those who peered from the ports and oar-holes saw that the
lanterns of their neighbors had been quenched, and perceived a milling
and seething as of low-driven clouds in the darkness, and saw that
foul black creatures, large as men and winged like oupires, were
clinging to the ranged oars in myriads. And those who dared to
approach the open hatches found that the decks, the rigging and the
masts were crowded with similar creatures, who, it seemed, were of
nocturnal habit and had come down in the manner of bats from their
caves in the island.</p>

<p>Then, like things of nightmare, the monsters began to invade the
hatches and assail the ports, clawing with hellish talons at the men
who opposed them. And, being somewhat hampered by their wings, they
were driven back with spears and arrows, but returned again and again
in a thickening press without number, cheeping with a faint and
bat-like sound. It was plain that they were vampires, for whenever
they had dragged a man down, as many of them as could gain mouthhold
would fasten on him incontinently, and suck his blood till little more
remained than a skinful of bones. The upper oar-decks, being half open
to the sky, were quickly usurped, and their crews overcome with a
hideous swarming; and the rowers in the orlops cried that the
sea-water was pouring in through the oar-holes as the ships sank
deeper beneath an ever-gathering weight.</p>

<p>All night, at the ports and hatches, the men of Euvoran fought the
vampires, taking turns in shifts when they wearied. Many of them were
seized and their blood sucked before the eyes of their fellows as the
night wore on; and the vampires, it seemed, were not to be slain by
mortal weapons, though the blood they had gorged came forth in
spouting rills from their wounded bodies. And thicklier they clustered
upon the fleet, till the biremes began to founder, and the rowers were
drowned in the sunken lower decks of certain triremes and
quadriremes.</p>

<p>King Euvoran was wroth at this unseemly turmoil that had
interrupted his supper; and when the golden arrack was spilt and the
dishes of rare meat were emptied on the floor by the vessel's violent
rocking, he would have issued from his cabin, fully armed, to try
conclusions with these piacular miscreants. But, even as he turned to
fling wide the cabin-door, there was a soft infernal pittering at the
port-holes behind him; and the women who were with him began to
shriek, and the fools cried out in terror. And the king saw in the
lamplight a grisly face with the teeth and nostrils of a flittermouse,
that leaned in through one of the cabin-ports. He sought to repel the
face, and thereafter, till dawn, he fought the vampires with those
very weapons he had designed for the slaying of the gazolba; and the
ship's captain, who was with him at supper, guarded a second port with
his claymore; and the others were held by two of the king's eunuchs,
armed with scimitars. In this warfare they were favored by the
smallness of the ports, which could hardly in any case have allowed
the free passage of their winged assailants. And, after lightless
hours of tedious, horrid struggle, the darkness became thinned with
brown twilight, and the vampires lifted from the vessels in a black
cloud and returned to their caves in the mile-high cliffs of that
unnamed island.</p>

<p>Heavy was the heart of Euvoran within him when he surveyed the
damage done to his proud argosies of war: for, among the fifteen
vessels, seven had sunk in the night, borne under and swamped by those
obscenely clinging hordes of oupires; and the decks of the others were
bloody as abbatoirs; and half of the sailors and rowers and
men-at-arms were lying flat and flaccid as empty wineskins after the
greedy drinking of the great bats. And the sails and banners were
shredded into rags; and everywhere, from beak to rudder of Euvoran's
galleys, there was the stain and reek of a Stymphalian foulness. So,
lest another eve should find them within wing-shot of that accursed
isle, the king ordered his remaining captains to weigh anchor; and the
other ships, with sea-water still awash in their orlops, and some with
drowned rowers still at the oars of their nether banks, drew slowly
and heavily to eastward, till the pitted walls of the isle began to
sink beneath the main. At eve there was no land in sight anywhere; and
after two days, still unharried by the vampires, they came to a coral
island, low in the wave, with a calm lagoon that was haunted only by
ocean-fowl. And there, for the first time, Euvoran paused to repair
his tattered sails, and pump the sea from his holds, and clean the
blood and vileness from his decks.</p>

<p>However, in spite of this disaster, the king abated not in any
degree his purpose, to sail ever on toward the fountains of the day,
until, as Geol had predicted, he should come again on the flown
gazolba and slay it with his own royal hand. So, for another moon,
they passed amid other and stranger archipelagoes, and penetrated
deeplier into the regions of myth and story.</p>

<p>Bravely they drove into mornings of amaranth crossed by gilded
lories, and noontides of darkly ardent sapphire where the rose
flamingoes went before them to lost, inviolate strands. The stars
changed above them, and under the alien-figured Signs they heard the
wild, melancholy crying of swans that flew southward fleeing the
winter of realms indiscoverable, and seeking the summer in trackless
worlds. And they held speech with fabulous men who wore for mantles
the ell-wide pennons of the roc, trailing far on the earth behind
them; and men who arrayed themselves in apyornis plumes. And they
spoke also with antic people whose bodies were covered with a down
like that of a new-hatched fowl, and others whose flesh was studded as
if with pin-feathers. But nowhere could they learn aught of the
gazolba.</p>

<p>At mid-forenoon, early in the sixth month of the voyage, a new and
unheard-of shore ascended from the deep, curving for many miles, from
northeast to southwest, with sheltered harbors, and cliffs and
pinnacled crags that were interspaced with low-lying verdurous
dales. As the galleys hove toward it, Euvoran and his captains saw
that towers were builded on certain of the highmost crags; but in the
haven below them there were no ships at anchor nor boats moving; and
the shore of the haven was a wilderness of green trees and grass. And,
sailing still nearer, and entering the harbor, they descried no
evident sign of man, other than the crag-reared towers.</p>

<p>The place, however, was full of an extraordinary number and variety
of birds, ranging in size from little tits and passerines to creatures
of greater wingspread than eagle or condor. They circled the ships in
coveys and great, motley flocks, seeming to be both curious and wary;
and Euvoran saw that a winged concourse, as it were, went to and fro
above the woods and about the cliffs and towers. He bethought him that
here was a likely haunt in which to track down the gazolba; so, arming
himself for the chase, he went ashore in a small boat with several of
his men.</p>

<p>The birds, even the largest, were patently timid and inoffensive;
for when the king landed on the beach, the very trees appeared to take
flight, so numerous were the fowl that soared and flew inland, or
sought the crags and pinnacles that rose beyond bow-shot. None
remained of the multitude visible shortly before; and Euvoran
marvelled at such cunning; and moreover he was somewhat exasperated,
for he wished not to depart without bringing down a trophy of his
skill, even though he should fail to find the gazolba itself. And he
deemed the behavior of the birds all the more curious because of the
island's solitude: for here there were no paths other than would be
made by forest animals; and the woods and meadows were wholly wild and
incult; and the towers were seemingly desolate, with sea-fowl and
land-fowl flying in and out of their empty windows.</p>

<p>The king and his men combed the deserted woods along the shore, and
came to a steep slope of bushes and dwarf cedars, whose upper incline
approached the tallest tower at one side. Here, at the slope's bottom,
Euvoran saw a small owl that slept in one of the cedars, as if wholly
unaware of the commotion made by the other birds in their flight. And
Euvoran trained an arrow and shot down the owl, though ordinarily he
would have spared a prey so paltry. And he was about to pick up the
fallen owl, when one of the men who accompanied him cried out as if in
alarm. Then, turning his head as he stooped beneath the foliage of the
cedar, the king beheld a brace of colossal birds, larger than any he
had yet descried on that isle, who came down from the tower like
falling thunderbolts. Before he could fit another arrow to the string,
they were upon him with the drumming of their mighty vans, and beating
him instantly to the ground, so that he was aware of them only as a
storm of dreadfully rushing plumes and a hurlyburly of cruel beaks and
talons. And, before his men could rally to assist him, one of the
birds fastened its huge claws in the shoulder-cape of the king's
mantle, not sparing the flesh beneath in its fell clutch, and carried
him away to the tower on the crag as easily as a ger-falcon would have
carried a small leveret. The king was wholly helpless, and he had
dropped his longbow beneath the onset of the birds, and his blowgun
had been shaken loose from the girdle at which it depended, and all
his darts and arrows were spilled. And he had no weapon remaining,
other than a sharp misericordia; and this he could not use to any
purpose against his captor in mid-air.</p>

<p>Swiftly he neared the tower, with a flock of lesser fowl circling
about him and shrieking as if with derision till he was deafened by
their din. And a sickness came upon him because of the height to which
he had been carried and the violence of his ascent; and giddily he saw
the walls of the tower sink past him with wide and portal-like
windows. Then, as he began to retch in his sickness, he was borne in
through one of the windows and was dropped rudely on the floor of a
high and spacious chamber.</p>

<p>He sprawled at full length on his face and lay vomiting for awhile,
heedless of his surroundings. Then, recovering somewhat, he raised
himself to a sitting position, and beheld before him, above a sort of
dais, an enormous perch of red gold and yellow ivory wrought in the
form of a new crescent arching upward. The perch was supported between
posts of black jasper flecked as if with blood, and upon it there sat
a most gigantic and uncommon bird, eyeing Euvoran with a grim and
dreadful and austere mien, as an emperor might eye the gutter-scum
that his guards have haled before him for some obscene offense. The
plumage of the bird was Tyrian purple, and his beak was like a mighty
pick-ax of pale bronze that darkened greenly toward the point, and he
clutched the perch with iron talons that were longer than the mailed
fingers of a warrior. His head was adorned with quills of turquoise
blue and amber yellow, like many a pointed crown; and about his long,
unfeathered throat, rough as the scaled skin of a dragon, he wore a
singular necklace composed of human heads, and the heads of various
ferine beasts such as the weasel, the wildcat, the stoat and the fox,
all of which had been reduced to a common size and were no larger than
groundnuts.</p>

<p>Euvoran was terrified by the aspect of this fowl; and his alarm was
not lessened when he saw that many other birds of a size inferior only
to his were sitting about the chamber on less costly and less elevated
perches, even as grandees of the realm might sit in the presence of
their sovereign. And behind Euvoran, like guards, there stood together
with its fellow the creatures that had rapt him to the tower.</p>

<p>Now, adding to his utter confounding, the great Tyrian-feathered
bird addressed him in human speech. And the bird said to him in a
harsh but magniloquent and majestic voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too hardily, O filth of mankind, thou hast intruded on the
peace of Ornava, isle that is sacred to the birds, and wantonly thou
hast slain one of my subjects. For know that I am the monarch of all
birds that fly, walk, wade or swim on this terraqueous globe of Earth;
and in Ornava is my seat and my capital. Verily, justice shall be done
upon thee for thy crime. But if thou hast aught to say in thy defence,
I will give thee hearing now, for I would not that even the vilest of
earthly vermin, and the most pernicious, should accuse me of inequity
or tyranny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, blustering somewhat, though sorely afraid at heart, Euvoran
gave answer to the bird, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came hither seeking the gazolba, which adorned my crown in
Ustaim, and was feloniously reft from me together with the crown
through the spell of a lawless necromancer. And know that I am
Euvoran, King of Ustaim, and I bow me to no bird, not even the
mightiest of that species.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereat the ruler of the birds, as if amazed and more indignant
than before, made question of Euvoran and interrogated him sharply
concerning the gazolba. And, learning that this bird had been slain by
sailors and afterwards stuffed, and that the whole purpose of Euvoran
in his voyage was to catch and kill it a second time and re-stuff it
if necessary, the ruler cried in a great and wrathful voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This helpeth not thy case but showeth thee guilty of a twofold
and a triple infamy: for thou hast owned a most abominable thing and
one that subverteth nature. In this my tower, as is right and proper,
I keep the bodies of men that my taxidermists have stuffed for me; but
truly, it is not allowable nor sufferable that man should do thus to
birds. So, for the sake of justice and retribution, I shall presently
commit thee to one of my taxidermists. Indeed, methinks that a stuffed
king (since even the vermin have kings) will serve to enhance my
collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that, he addressed Euvoran's guards and enjoined
them: &ldquo;Away with this vileness. Confine it to the man-cage, and
maintain a strict watch before it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Euvoran, urged and directed by the pecking of his guards, was
compelled to climb a sort of sloping ladder with broad rungs of teak,
that led from the chamber to one above it in the tower's top. In the
center of this room there was a bamboo cage of capacity more than
ample for the housing of six men. The king was driven into the cage,
and the birds bolted the door upon him with their claws, which seemed
to have the deftness of fingers. Thereafter one of them remained by
the cage, eyeing Euvoran vigilantly through the spaces of the bars;
and the other flew away through a great window and did not return.</p>

<p>The king sat down on a litter of straw, since the cage contained no
better provision for his comfort. Despair was heavy upon him, and it
seemed that his plight was both dreadful and ignominious. And sorely
was he astonished, that a bird should speak with human speech,
insulting and reviling humankind; and he deemed it an equally
monstrous thing that a bird should dwell in royal state, with
servitors to do his will, and the pomp and power of a king. And,
pondering these unholy prodigies, Euvoran waited for his doom in the
man-cage; and after awhile, water and raw grain were brought to him in
earthen vessels; but he could not eat the grain. And still later, as
the day drew toward afternoon, he heard a shouting of men and a
shrieking of birds below the tower; and above these noises, anon,
there were clashings as of weapons and thuddings as of boulders
loosened from the crag. So Euvoran knew that his sailors and soldiers,
having seen him borne into captivity in the tower, were assailing the
place in an effort to succor him. And the noises waxed, mounting to a
most tremendous and atrocious din, and there were cries as of people
mortally wounded, and a vengeful shrilling as of harpies in
battle. Then, presently, the clamor ebbed away, and the shoutings grew
faint, and Eurovan knew that his men had failed to take the tower. And
hope waned within him, dying in a darker murk of despair.</p>

<p>So the afternoon went over, declining seaward, and the sun touched
Euvoran with its level beams through a western window and colored the
bars of his cage with a mockery of gold. Presently, the light flowed
from the room, and after awhile the twilight rose, weaving a tremulous
phantom web of the pale air. And between the sunset and the darkness,
a night-guard came in to relieve the day-flying owl who warded the
captive king. The newcomer was a nyctalops with glowing yellow eyes,
and he stood taller that Euvoran himself, and was formed and feathered
somewhat in the burly fashion of an owl, and he had the stout legs of
a megapode. Euvoran was uncomfortably aware of the bird's eyes, which
burned upon him with a brighter bale as the dusk deepened. Hardly
could he sustain that ever vigilant scrutiny. But anon the moon rose,
being but little past the full, and poured a spectral quicksilver into
the room, and paled the eyes of the bird; and Euvoran conceived a
desperate plan.</p>

<p>His captors, deeming all his weapons lost, had neglected to remove
from his girdle the misericordia, which was long and double-edged and
needle-sharp at the tip. And stealthily he gripped the hilt of his
misericordia under his mantle, and feigned a sudden illness with
groanings and tossings and convulsions that threw him against the
bars. And, even as he had schemed, the great nyctalops came nearer,
curious to learn what ailed the king; and stooping, he leaned his
owl-like head between the bars above Euvoran. And the king, pretending
a more violent convulsion, drew the misericordia from its sheath and
struck quickly at the outstretched throat of the bird.</p>

<p>Shrewdly the thrust went home, piercing the deepest veins, and the
squawking of the bird was choked by his own blood; and he fell,
flapping noisily, so that Euvoran feared that all the occupants of the
tower would be awakened by the sound. But it seemed that his fears
were bootless; for none came to the chamber; and soon the flappings
ceased, and the nyctalops lay still in a great heap of ruffled
feathers. Thereupon the king proceeded with his plan, and shot back
the bolts of the wide-latticed bamboo door with small
difficulty. Then, going to the head of the teak-wood ladder which ran
to the room beneath, he looked down and beheld the ruler of the birds
asleep in the moonlight on his chryselephantine perch, with his
terrible pick-ax beak under his wing. And Euvoran was afraid to
descend into the chamber, lest the ruler should awake and see him. And
also, it occurred to him that the lower stories of the tower might
well be guarded by such fowl as the nocturnal creature he had
slain.</p>

<p>Again his despair returned upon him; but being of a sleightful and
crafty bent, Euvoran bethought him of another scheme. With much labor,
using the misericordia, he skinned the mighty nyctalops, and cleaned
the blood from its plumage as best he could. Then Euvoran wrapped
himself in the skin, with the head of the nyctalops rearing above his
own head, and eyeholes in its burly throat through which he could look
out amidst the feathers. And the skin fitted him well enough because
of his pigeon-breast and his potbelly; and his spindle shanks were
hidden behind the heavy shanks of the bird as he walked.</p>

<p>Then, imitating the gait and carriage of this fowl, the king
descended the ladder, treading cautiously to avoid a fall and making
little noise, lest the ruler of the birds should awaken and detect his
imposture. And the ruler was all alone, and he slept without stirring
while Euvoran reached the floor and crossed the chamber stealthily to
another ladder, leading to the next room below.</p>

<p>In the next room there were many great birds asleep on perches, and
the king was nigh to perishing with terror as he passed among
them. Some of the birds moved a little and chirped drowsily, as if
aware of his presence; but none challenged him. And he went down into
a third room, and was startled to see therein the standing figures of
many men, some in the garb of sailors, and others clad like merchants,
and others nude and ruddled with bright ores like savages. And the men
were still and stark as if enchanted; and the king feared them little
less than he had feared the birds. But remembering that which the
ruler had told him, he divined that these were persons who had been
captured even as he himself, and had been slain by the birds and
preserved through the art of an avian taxidermy. And, trembling, he
passed down to another room, which was full of stuffed cats and tigers
and serpents and various other enemies of birdkind. And the room below
this was the ground story of the tower, and its windows and portals by
several gigantic night-fowl similar to those whose skin was worn by
the king. Here, indeed, was his greatest peril and the supreme trial
of his courage; for the birds eyed him alertly with their fiery golden
orbs, and they greeted him with a soft whoo-whooing as of owls. And
the knees of Euvoran knocked together behind the bird-shanks; but,
imitating the sound in reply, he passed among the guards and was not
molested by them. And, reaching an open portal of the tower, he saw
the moonlight rock of the crag lying at a distance of no more than two
cubits below him; and he hopped from the doorsill in the manner of a
fowl, and found his way precariously from ledge to ledge along the
crag, till he reached the upper beginning of that declivity at whose
bottom he had slain the little owl. Here his descent was easier, and
he came anon to the woods around the harbor.</p>

<p>But, ere he could enter the woods, there was a shrill singing of
arrows about him, and the king was wounded slightly by one of the
arrows, and he roared out in anger, and dropped the mantling
birdskin. Thereby, no doubt, he was saved from death at the hands of
his own men, who were coming through the woods with intent to assail
the tower at night. And, learning this, the king forgave the jeopardy
in which their arrows had placed him. But he thought it best to
refrain from attacking the tower, and to quit the isle with all
dispatch. So returning to his flagship, he ordered all his captains to
set sail immediately; for, knowing the baleful power of the
bird-monarch, he was more than apprehensive of pursuit; and he deemed
it well to place a wide interval of sea between his vessels and that
isle ere dawn. So the galleys drew from the tranquil harbor, and
rounding a northeastern promontory, they went due east in a course
contrary to the moon. And, Euvoran, sitting in his cabin, regaled
himself with a variety and plenitude of viands to make up for his
fasting in the man-cage; and he drank a whole gallon of palm-wine and
added thereto a jarful of the puissant pale-gold arrack of Sotar.</p>

<p>Halfway betwixt midnight and morn, when the isle of Ornava was left
far behind, the steersmen of the vessels beheld a wall of ebon cloud
that rose swiftly athwart the heavens, spreading and toppling in
towers of thunder, till the storm overtook Euvoran's fleet and drove
it on as if with the loosed hurricanes of hell through a welter of
unstarred chaos. The ships were sundered in the gloom and were borne
far apart; and at daybreak the king's quadrireme was alone in a
prone-rushing tumult of mingled wave and cloud; and the mast was
shattered, along with most of the beef-wood oars; and the vessel was a
toy for the demons of the tempest.</p>

<p>For three days and nights, with no glimmer of sun or star discerned
through the ever-boiling murk, the vessel was hurled onward as if
caught in a cataract of elements pouring to some bottomless gulf
beyond the fringes of the world. And early on the fourth day the
clouds were somewhat riven; but a wind still blew like the breath of
perdition. Then, lifting darkly through the spray and vapor, a
half-seen land arose before the prow, and the helmsman and the rowers
were wholly helpless to turn the doomed ship from its course. And
shortly after, with a great crashing of its carven beak, and a
terrible rending of timbers, the vessel struck on a low reef hidden by
the flying foam, and its lower decks were flooded quickly. And the
vessel began to founder, with the poop tilting sharply and more
sharply, and the water frothing at the lee bulwarks.</p>

<p>Gaunt and cragged and austere was the shore beyond the reef, beheld
only through the veils of the sea's foaming fury. And scant, it
seemed, was the hope of reaching land. But, ere the wrecked argosy had
gone beneath him, Euvoran lashed himself with ropes of coir to an
empty wine-barrel, and cast himself from the sloping deck. And those
of his men who were not already drowned in the hold or swept overboard
by the typhoon, leapt after him into that high wallowing sea, some
trusting only to their might as swimmers and others clinging to casks
or broken spars or planks. And most were drawn under in the seething
maelstroms or were beaten to death on the rocks; and of all the ship's
company, the king alone survived and was cast ashore with the breath
of life unquenched within him by the bitter sea.</p>

<p>Half-drowned and senseless, he lay where the surf had spewed him on
a shelving beach. Soon the gale forgot its violence, and the billows
came in with falling crests, and the clouds went over in a rack of
pearl, and the sun, climbing above the rock, shone down upon Euvoran
from a deep immaculate azure. And the king, still dazed from the
buffeting rudeness of the sea, heard dimly and as if in a dream the
shrilling of an unknown bird. Then, opening his eyes, he beheld
betwixt himself and the sun, librating on spread wings, that
various-colored glory of plumes and feathers which he knew as the
gazolba. Crying again with a voice that was harsh and shrill as that
of the peafowl, the bird hung above him for a moment, and then flew
inland through a rift among the crags.</p>

<p>Forgetful of all his hardships and the loss of his proud galleys of
war, the king unbound himself in haste from the empty barrel; and,
rising giddily, he followed the bird. And, though he was now
weaponless, it seemed to him that the fulfillment of the oracle of
Geol was at hand. And hopefully he armed himself with a great cudgel
of driftwood and gathered heavy pebbles from the beach as he pursued
the gazolba.</p>

<p>Beyond the cleft in the high and rugged crags, he found a sheltered
valley with quiet-flowing springs, and woods of exotic leaf, and
fragrant orient shrubs in blossom. Here, from bough to bough before
his astounded eyes, there darted great numbers of fowl that wore the
gaudy plumage of the gazolba; and among them he was unable to
distinguish the one he had followed, deeming it the avian garniture of
his lost crown. The multitude of these birds was a thing beyond his
comprehension: since he and all his people had thought the stuffed
fowl unique and fellowless throughout the world, even as the other
components of the crown of Ustaim. And it came to him that his fathers
had been deceived by the mariners who had slain the birds in a remote
isle, swearing later that it was the last of its kind.</p>

<p>However, though wrath and confusion were in his heart, Euvoran
bethought him that a single bird from the flock would still stand as
the emblem and the talisman of his royalty in Ustaim, and would
vindicate his quest among the isles of dawn. So, with a valiant
hurling of sticks and stones, he tried to bring down one of the
gazolbas. And ever before him as he chased them, the birds flew from
tree to tree with a horrid shrieking, and a flurry of plumes that
wrought an imperial splendor on the air. And at length, by his own
good aim or the cast of chance, Euvoran slew him a gazolba.</p>

<p>As he went to retrieve the fallen bird, he saw a man in tattered
raiment of an uncouth cut, armed with a rude bow, and carrying over
his shoulder a brace of gazolbas tied together at the feet with tough
grass. And the man wore in lieu of other headgear the skin and
feathers of the same fowl. He came toward Euvoran, shouting
indistinctly through his matted beard; and the king beheld him with
surprise and anger, and cried loudly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vile serf, how darest thou to kill the bird that is sacred to
the kings of Ustaim? And knowest thou not that only the kings may wear
the bird for headgear? I, who am King Euvoran, shall hold thee to a
dire accounting of these deeds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, eyeing Euvoran strangely, the man laughed a long and
derisive laugh, as if he deemed the king a person somewhat addled in
his wits. And he seemed to find much merriment in the aspect of the
king, whose garments were draggled and were stiff and stained with the
drying sea-water, and whose turban had been snatched away by the felon
waves, leaving his baldness without disguise. And when he had done
laughing, the man said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verily, this is the first and only jest that I have heard in
nine years, and my laughter must be forgiven. For nine years agone I
was shipwrecked on this isle, being a sea-captain from the far
southwestern land of Ullotroi, and the sole member of my ship's
company that survived and came safe to shore. In all those years I
have held speech with no other man, since the isle is remote from the
maritime routes, and has no people other than the birds. And as for
your questions, they are readily answered: I kill these fowl to avert
the pangs of famine, since there is little else on the isle for
sustenance, apart from roots and berries. And I wear on my head the
skin and feathers of the fowl because my tarboosh was stolen by the
sea whenas it flung me rudely upon this strand. And I wot not of the
strange laws that you mention; and moreover, your kingship is a matter
that concerns me little, since the isle is kingless, and you and I are
alone thereon, and I am the stronger of us twain and the better
armed. Therefore be well advised, O King Euvoran; and since you have
slain yourself a bird, I counsel you to pick up the bird and come with
me. Truly, it may be that I can help you in the matter of spitting and
broiling this fowl: for I must deem that you are more familiar with
the products of the culinary art than with the practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, hearing all this, the wrath of Euvoran sank within him like a
flame that fails for oil. Clearly he saw the plight to which his
voyage had brought him in the end; and bitterly he discerned the irony
that was hidden in the true oracle of Geol. And he knew that the
wreckage of his fleet of war was scattered among lost islands or blown
into seas unvoyageable. And it came to him that never again should he
see the marble houses of Aramoam, nor live in pleasant luxury, nor
administer the dooms of law between the torturer and the executioner
in the hall of justice, nor wear the gazolba-crown amid the plaudits
of his people. So, not being utterly bereft of reason, he bowed him to
his destiny.</p>

<p>And he said to the sea-captain, &ldquo;There is sense in what you
say. Therefore lead on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, laden with the spoils of the chase, Euvoran and the captain,
whose name was Naz Obbamar, repaired companionably to a cave in the
rocky hill-slope of the isle's interior, which Naz Obbamar had chosen
for his abode. Here the captain made a fire of dry cedar boughs, and
showed the king the proper manner in which to pluck his fowl and broil
it over the fire, turning it slowly on a spit of green
camphor-wood. And Euvoran, being famished, found the meat of the
gazolba far from unpalatable, though somewhat lean and strongly
flavored. And after they had eaten, Naz Obbamar brought out from the
cave a rough jar of the island clay containing a wine he had made from
certain berries; and he and Euvoran drank from the jar by turns, and
told each other the tale of their adventures, and forgot for a while
the rudeness and desolation of their plight.</p>

<p>Thereafter they shared the isle of gazolbas, killing and eating the
birds as their hunger ordained. Sometimes, for a great delicacy, they
slew and ate some other fowl that was more rarely met on the isle,
though common enough, perhaps in Ustaim or Ullotroi. And King Euvoran
made him a headdress from the skin and plumes of the gazolba, even as
Naz Obbamar had done. And this was the fashion of their days till the
end.</p>
